            <p class="textParagraph"> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were <br>
             shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The <br>
             evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud <br>
             of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird <span class="tag lineNumber">10045</span><br>
             through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of <br>
             sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to <br>
             run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the <br>
             throng of players and his eyes were weak and watery.  Rody <br>
             Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third <span class="tag lineNumber">10050</span><br>
             line all the fellows said.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but  Nasty Roche was a <br>
             stink.  Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper <br>
             in the refectory.  Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the <br>
             Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:<span class="tag lineNumber">10055</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What is your name? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen had answered:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―  Stephen Dedalus. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Then  Nasty Roche had said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What kind of a name is that? <span class="tag lineNumber">10060</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> And when  Stephen had not been able to answer  Nasty <br>
             Roche had asked:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―What is your father? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen had answered:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―A gentleman. <span class="tag lineNumber">10065</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Then  Nasty Roche had asked:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Nasty Roche</span>―Is he a magistrate? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, <br>
             making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish <br>
             with cold. He kept his hands in the sidepockets of his belted <span class="tag lineNumber">10070</span><br>
             grey suit. That was a belt round his jacket. And belt was also to <br>
             give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow had said to  Cantwell:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―I'd give you such a belt in a second. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Cantwell had answered:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cantwell</span>―Go and fight your match. Give  Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd like <span class="tag lineNumber">10075</span><br>
             to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him <br>
             not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! <br>
             The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said good- <br>
             bye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and <span class="tag lineNumber">10080</span><br>
             her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see <br>
             that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was <br>
             not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two <br>
              fiveshilling  pieces for pocket money. And his father had told <br>
             him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever <span class="tag lineNumber">10085</span><br>
             he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the <br>
             castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, <br>
             his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off <br>
             with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from <br>
             the car, waving their hands:<span class="tag lineNumber">10090</span><br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus, Simon Dedalus</span>
              <p class="textParagraph">―Goodbye,  Stephen, goodbye!<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph">―Goodbye,  Stephen, goodbye!<br> </p>
            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of <br>
             the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through <br>
             the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their <span class="tag lineNumber">10095</span><br>
             legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then  Jack <br>
             Lawton's yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other <br>
             boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then <br>
             stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going <br>
             home for the holidays. After supper in the  studyhall  he would <span class="tag lineNumber">10100</span><br>
             change the number pasted up inside his desk from  seventyseven  <br>
             to  seventysix .<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It would be better to be in the  studyhall  than out there in the <br>
             cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the <br>
             castle. He wondered from which window  Hamilton Rowan <span class="tag lineNumber">10105</span><br>
             had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds <br>
             at that time under the windows. One day when he had been <br>
             called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the <br>
             soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a <br>
             piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and <span class="tag lineNumber">10110</span><br>
             warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a <br>
             book. Perhaps   <span class="hide"> 52.640379 -1.132563 </span>   Leicester Abbey   was like that. And there were <br>
             nice sentences in  Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were <br>
             like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling <br>
             from.<span class="tag lineNumber">10115</span><br> </p>
            <p class="lg">
                <span class="emph">  Wolsey died in   <span class="hide"> 52.640379 -1.132563 </span>   Leicester Abbey   </span>  <br>

            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, <span class="tag lineNumber">10120</span><br>
             leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. <br>
             He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That <br>
             was mean of  Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch be- <br>
             cause he would not swop his little  snuffbox  for  Wells 's sea- <br>
             soned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and <span class="tag lineNumber">10125</span><br>
             slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat <br>
             jump plop into the scum. He shivered and longed to cry. It <br>
             would be so nice to be at home. Mother was sitting at the fire <br>
             with  Dante  waiting for  Brigid  to bring in the tea. She had her <br>
             feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they <span class="tag lineNumber">10130</span><br>
             had such a lovely warm smell!  Dante  knew a lot of things. She <br>
             had taught him where the   <span class="hide"> -18.615949 41.280858 </span>   Mozambique Channel   was and what <br>
             was   <span class="hide"> 38.627003 -90.199404 </span>   the longest river in America   and what was the name of the <br>
             highest mountain in the moon.  Father Arnall  knew more than <br>
              Dante  because he was a priest but both his father and  uncle <span class="tag lineNumber">10135</span><br>
             Charles  said that  Dante  was a clever woman and a  wellread  <br>
             woman. And when  Dante  made that noise after dinner and <br>
             then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A voice cried far out on the playground:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―All in! <span class="tag lineNumber">10140</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">other voices from the lower and third lines</span>―All in! All in! <br> </p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went <br>
             among them, glad to go in.  Rody Kickham  held the ball by its <br>
             greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he <span class="tag lineNumber">10145</span><br>
             walked on without even answering the fellow.  Simon Moonan  <br>
             told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow <br>
             turned to  Simon Moonan  and said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―We all know why you speak. You are  McGlade 's suck. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Suck was a queer word. The fellow called  Simon Moonan  <span class="tag lineNumber">10150</span><br>
             that name because  Simon Moonan  used to tie the prefect's false <br>
             sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be <br>
             angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands <br>
             in the lavatory of the   <span class="hide"> 53.342872 -6.260651 </span>   Wicklow Hotel   and his father pulled the <br>
             stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down <span class="tag lineNumber">10155</span><br>
             through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down <br>
             slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. <br>
             Only louder.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made <br>
             him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you <span class="tag lineNumber">10160</span><br>
             turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then <br>
             a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. <br>
             That was a very queer thing.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and <br>
             wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a <span class="tag lineNumber">10165</span><br>
             light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the <br>
             fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It was the hour for sums.  Father Arnall  wrote a hard sum on <br>
             the board and then said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lan- <span class="tag lineNumber">10170</span><br>
             caster! <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt <br>
             confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that <br>
             was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was <br>
             no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not <span class="tag lineNumber">10175</span><br>
             lose.  Father Arnall 's face looked very black but he was not in a <br>
             wax: he was laughing. Then  Jack Lawton  cracked his fingers <br>
             and  Father Arnall  looked at his copybook and said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, <br>
             York! Forge ahead! <span class="tag lineNumber">10180</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Jack Lawton  looked over from his side. The little silk badge <br>
             with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue <br>
             sailor top on.  Stephen  felt his own face red too, thinking of all <br>
             the bets about who would get first place in elements,  Jack <br>
             Lawton  or he. Some weeks  Jack Lawton  got the card for first <span class="tag lineNumber">10185</span><br>
             and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge <br>
             fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard <br>
              Father Arnall 's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and <br>
             he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white <br>
             because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the <span class="tag lineNumber">10190</span><br>
             sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those <br>
             were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place <br>
             and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: <br>
             pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink <br>
             roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be <span class="tag lineNumber">10195</span><br>
             like those colours: and he remembered the song about the wild <br>
             rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have <br>
             a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the <br>
             rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat <span class="tag lineNumber">10200</span><br>
             looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not <br>
             eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he <br>
             drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with <br>
             a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the <br>
             scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were <span class="tag lineNumber">10205</span><br>
             cold and damp.  Nasty Roche  and  Saurin  drank cocoa that their <br>
             people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; <br>
             that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fel- <br>
             lows said.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fa- <span class="tag lineNumber">10210</span><br>
             thers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed <br>
             to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he <br>
             could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers <br>
             to be over and to be in bed.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He drank another cup of hot tea and  Fleming  said:<span class="tag lineNumber">10215</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I don't know,  Stephen  said. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Fleming</span>―Sick in your breadbasket,  Fleming  said, because your face <br>
             looks white. It will go away. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―O yes,  Stephen  said. <span class="tag lineNumber">10220</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his <br>
             heart if you could be sick in that place.  Fleming  was very <br>
             decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on <br>
             the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he <br>
             heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps <span class="tag lineNumber">10225</span><br>
             of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he <br>
             closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a <br>
             tunnel. That night at   <span class="hide"> 53.277911 -6.105844 </span>   Dalkey   the train had roared like that and <br>
             then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed <br>
             his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; <span class="tag lineNumber">10230</span><br>
             roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and <br>
             then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the <br>
             matting in the middle of the refectory,  Paddy Rath  and  Jimmy <br>
             Magee  and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and <span class="tag lineNumber">10235</span><br>
             the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the <br>
             lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every <br>
             single fellow had a different way of walking.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a <br>
             game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an <span class="tag lineNumber">10240</span><br>
             instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door <br>
             with some boys and  Simon Moonan  was knotting his false <br>
             sleeves. He was telling them something about   <span class="hide"> 52.888640 -8.428450 </span>   Tullabeg  .<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Then he went away from the door and  Wells  came over to <br>
              Stephen  and said:<span class="tag lineNumber">10245</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―Tell us,  Dedalus , do you kiss your mother every night before <br>
             you go to bed? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen  answered:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I do. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Wells  turned to the other fellows and said:<span class="tag lineNumber">10250</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night <br>
             before he goes to bed. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, <br>
             laughing.  Stephen  blushed under their eyes and said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―I do not. <span class="tag lineNumber">10255</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Wells  said:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wells</span>―O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother <br>
             before he goes to bed. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> They all laughed again.  Stephen  tried to laugh with them. <br>
             He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What <span class="tag lineNumber">10260</span><br>
             was the right answer to the question? He had given two and <br>
             still  Wells  laughed. But  Wells  must know the right answer for <br>
             he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of  Wells 's mother <br>
             but he did not dare to raise his eyes to  Wells 's face. He did not <br>
             like  Wells 's face. It was  Wells  who had shouldered him into the <span class="tag lineNumber">10265</span><br>
             square ditch the day before because he would not swop his <br>
             little  snuffbox  for  Wells 's seasoned hacking chestnut, the con- <br>
             queror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it <br>
             was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow <br>
             had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.<span class="tag lineNumber">10270</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, <br>
             when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the <br>
             playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase <br>
             inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right <br>
             answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his <span class="tag lineNumber">10275</span><br>
             mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like <br>
             that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. <br>
             That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips <br>
             were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little <br>
             noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?<span class="tag lineNumber">10280</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Sitting in the  studyhall  he opened the lid of his desk and <br>
             changed the number pasted up inside from  seventyseven  to <br>
              seventysix . But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but <br>
             one time it would come because the earth moved round always.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his <span class="tag lineNumber">10285</span><br>
             geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds.  Fleming  had a <br>
             box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured <br>
             the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two <br>
             brushes in  Dante 's press, the brush with the green velvet back <br>
             for  Parnell  and the brush with the maroon velvet back for <span class="tag lineNumber">10290</span><br>
              Michael Davitt . But he had not told  Fleming  to colour them <br>
             those colours.  Fleming  had done it himself.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could <br>
             not learn the names of places in  America . Still they were all <br>
             different places that had those different names. They were all in <span class="tag lineNumber">10295</span><br>
             different countries and the countries were in continents and the <br>
             continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he <br>
             had written there: himself, his name and where he was.<br> </p>

             written on the opposite page:<span class="tag lineNumber">10310</span><br> </p>
            <p class="lg">
                <span class="emph">  Stephen Dedalus  is my name, </span>  <br>
                <span class="emph">  Ireland  is my nation. </span>  <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. <span class="tag lineNumber">10315</span><br>
             Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came <br>
             to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page <br>
             again. What was after  the universe ? Nothing. But was there <br>
             anything round  the universe  to show where it stopped before <br>
             the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but there could <span class="tag lineNumber">10320</span><br>
             be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to <br>
             think about everything and everywhere. Only  God  could do <br>
             that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he <br>
             could think only of  God .  God  was  God 's name just as his name <br>
             was  Stephen .  <span class="emph"> Dieu </span>  was the French for  God  and that was  God 's <span class="tag lineNumber">10325</span><br>
             name too; and when anyone prayed to  God  and said  <span class="emph"> Dieu </span>  then <br>
              God  knew at once that it was a French person that was pray- <br>
              ing. But though there were different names for  God  in all the <br>
             different languages in the world and  God  understood what all <br>
             the people who prayed said in their different languages still <span class="tag lineNumber">10330</span><br>
              God  remained always the same  God  and  God 's real name was <br>
              God .<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel <br>
             his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily <br>
             at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. <span class="tag lineNumber">10335</span><br>
             He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the <br>
             maroon, because  Dante  had ripped the green velvet back off <br>
             the brush that was for  Parnell  one day with her scissors and <br>
             had told him that  Parnell  was a bad man. He wondered if they <br>
             were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. <span class="tag lineNumber">10340</span><br>
             There were two sides in it:  Dante  was on one side and his <br>
             father and  Mr Casey  were on the other side but his mother and <br>
              uncle Charles  were on no side. Every day there was something <br>
             in the paper about it.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant <span class="tag lineNumber">10345</span><br>
             and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt <br>
             small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry <br>
             and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they <br>
             studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the <br>
             vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and <span class="tag lineNumber">10350</span><br>
             then again another term and then again the vacation. It was <br>
             like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the <br>
             noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and <br>
             closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, <br>
             stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. <span class="tag lineNumber">10355</span><br>
             Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and <br>
             yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. <br>
             First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how <br>
             cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could <br>
             sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers <span class="tag lineNumber">10360</span><br>
             and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be <br>
             lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from <br>
             the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm <br>
             all over, ever so warm; ever so warm and yet he shivered a little <br>
             and still wanted to yawn.<span class="tag lineNumber">10365</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the  study- <br>
             hall  after the others and down the staircase and along the <br>
             corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the <br>
             chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. <br>
             There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the <span class="tag lineNumber">10370</span><br>
             colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: <br>
             but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the <br>
             seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the <br>
             hob to make punch.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his <span class="tag lineNumber">10375</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy <br>
             smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at <br>
             the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air <br>
             and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peas- <br>
             ants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they <span class="tag lineNumber">10385</span><br>
             prayed. They lived in   <span class="hide"> 53.293785 -6.687040 </span>   Clane , , a fellow said: there were little <br>
             cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the  half- <br>
             door  of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had come <br>
             past from   <span class="hide"> 53.251067 -6.665231 </span>   Sallins  . It would be lovely to sleep for one night in <br>
             that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by <span class="tag lineNumber">10390</span><br>
             the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, <br>
             air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there <br>
             between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It <br>
             made him afraid to think of how it was.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last <span class="tag lineNumber">10395</span><br>
             prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the <br>
             trees.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and <br>
             drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May <br>
             Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace <span class="tag lineNumber">10400</span><br>
             and may Thy blessing be always upon us through <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormi- <br>
             tory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and <br>
             then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas <span class="tag lineNumber">10405</span><br>
             was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He <br>
             rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and <br>
             knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly <br>
             quickly fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoul- <br>
            ders shaking as he murmured:<span class="tag lineNumber">10410</span><br> </p>

             gether under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But <br>
             he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would <span class="tag lineNumber">10420</span><br>
             stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory goodnight. He <br>
             peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow <br>
             curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. <br>
             The light was lowered quietly.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase <span class="tag lineNumber">10425</span><br>
             and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the <br>
             dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night <br>
             with eyes as big as  carriagelamps ? They said it was the ghost of <br>
             a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw <br>
             the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress <span class="tag lineNumber">10430</span><br>
             were in the  ironingroom  above the staircase. It was long ago. <br>
             The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there but the hall <br>
             was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He <br>
             wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and <br>
             strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of <span class="tag lineNumber">10435</span><br>
             strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw <br>
             their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his <br>
              deathwound . But only the dark was where they looked: only <br>
             dark silent air. Their master had received his  deathwound  on <br>
             the battlefield of   <span class="hide"> 50.075538 14.437800 </span>   Prague   far away over the sea. He was standing <span class="tag lineNumber">10440</span><br>
             on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale <br>
             and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark <br>
             was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great <br>

             figures of marshals who had received their  deathwound  on <br>
             battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say <br>

             cheered. The peasant women stood at the  halfdoors , the men <br>

             clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the <br>

             was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening <br>
             light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a <br>

             up.  Wolsey  died there. The abbots buried him themselves.<span class="tag lineNumber">10525</span><br> </p>

             two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet <br>
             tucked up to jump, black shiny eyes to look out of. They could <br>

             Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the <br>
             fellows had told him it was when  Little  had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. <br>
              Wells  too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The <br>
             rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there <br>
             would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the cata- <br>
             falque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel <br>
             slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the <span class="tag lineNumber">10600</span><br>
             community off the main avenue of limes. And  Wells  would be <br>
             sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll <br>

             had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was <br>

             one of his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one <br>
             side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. <br>

             boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense <br>
             in  and it had hissed on the red coals.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  The fellows were talking together in little groups here and <br>
             there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have <br>
             grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him <span class="tag lineNumber">11200</span><br>
             down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He <br>
             had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder- <br>
             path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and <br>
             some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.<br> </p>

             cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be the <br>
             prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the play- <br>
             playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and <span class="tag lineNumber">11210</span><br>
             lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the <br>
             cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, <br>
             pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all <br>
             looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody <br>
             about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the <br>
             square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run <span class="tag lineNumber">11245</span><br>
             away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had <br>
             nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy <br>
             sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down <br>
             to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he <br>
             was at the door. It was the night of the match against the <span class="tag lineNumber">11250</span><br>
             Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red and green <br>
             apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And <br>
             one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers in- <br>
             instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker <br>
             Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was <span class="tag lineNumber">11255</span><br>
             always at his nails, paring them.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a <br>
             girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of <br>
             <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory</span> but protestants could not understand it and <br>
             made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into <span class="tag lineNumber">11260</span><br>
             the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting <br>
             on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on <br>
             the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his <br>
             hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand <br>
             was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and <span class="tag lineNumber">11265</span><br>
             then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing <br>
             down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed <br>
             out behind her like gold in the sun. <span class="emph">Tower of Ivory. House of <br>

             all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale <br>
             water there. And behind the door of one of the  closets there <br>
             was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. <br>
             In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from <span class="tag lineNumber">11330</span><br>
             here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you <br>
             were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a <br>
             sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of <br>
             whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what <br>
             was the pain like. There were different kinds of pains  for all the <span class="tag lineNumber">11335</span><br>
             different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high <br>
             whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It <br>
             made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said <br>
             too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: <br>
             but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let <span class="tag lineNumber">11340</span><br>
             down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you <br>
             undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, <br>
             the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it <br>
             that way?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He looked at Athy's rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky <span class="tag lineNumber">11345</span><br>
             hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson <br>
             would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny <br>
             cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the <br>
             nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them <br>
             too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed <span class="tag lineNumber">11350</span><br>
             nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish <br>
             hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with <br>
             cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high <br>
             whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end <br>
             of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling <span class="tag lineNumber">11355</span><br>
             of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish <br>
             hands, clean and strong  and gentle. And he thought of what <br>
             Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Cor- <br>
             Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was <br>
             best of his play not to. But that was not why.<span class="tag lineNumber">11360</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  A voice from far out on the playgrounds cried: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a fellow</span>―All in! <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  And other voices cried: <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listen- <span class="tag lineNumber">11365</span><br>
             ing to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and <br>
             fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting <br>
             beside the boy to show him how to hold the pen. He had tried <br>

             out the full curves of the capital.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. <span class="tag lineNumber">11375</span><br>
             All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were <br>
             they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had <br>
             said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press <br>
             in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it <br>
             by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away <span class="tag lineNumber">11380</span><br>
             with it and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible <br>
             sin, to go in  quietly there at night, to open the dark press and <br>
             steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the <br>
             altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while <br>
             the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung <span class="tag lineNumber">11385</span><br>
             the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in <br>
             the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. <br>
             But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He <br>
             thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it <br>
             thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped <span class="tag lineNumber">11390</span><br>
             lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be <br>
             found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible <br>
             and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account <br>
             of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had <br>
             made his first holy communion in  the chapel he had shut his <span class="tag lineNumber">11395</span><br>
             eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and <br>
             when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy com- <br>
             communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath <br>
             after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It <br>
             made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark <span class="tag lineNumber">11400</span><br>
             purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. <br>
             But the faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel <br>
             a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day <br>
             of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. <br>
             And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the <span class="tag lineNumber">11405</span><br>
             happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day <br>
             he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. <br>
             But he said: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Napoleon</span>―Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which <br>

             Arnall gave out the themebooks and he said that they were <br>
             scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with <br>
             the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's <span class="tag lineNumber">11415</span><br>
             theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and <br>
             Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to <br>
             any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack <br>
             Lawton to decline the noun <span class="emph">mare</span> and Jack Lawton stopped at <br>
             the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural. <span class="tag lineNumber">11420</span><br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall <br>
             sternly. You, the leader of the class! <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. <br>
             Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and <br>
             more quiet as each boy tried to answer and could not. But his <span class="tag lineNumber">11425</span><br>
             face was blacklooking and his eyes were staring though his <br>
             voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said <br>
             that that word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the <br>
             book and shouted at him: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the <span class="tag lineNumber">11430</span><br>
             idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of <br>
             you. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between <br>
             the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme- <br>
             books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and <span class="tag lineNumber">11435</span><br>
             Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that <br>
             it was a little red from the wax he was in.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he <br>
             allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that <br>
             made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a <span class="tag lineNumber">11440</span><br>
             wax? It was because he was allowed because a priest would <br>
             know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one <br>
             time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps <br>
             he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister <br>
             did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provin- <span class="tag lineNumber">11445</span><br>
             cial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was <br>
             called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were <br>
             all clever men. They could all have become highup people in <br>
             the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered <br>
             what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and <span class="tag lineNumber">11450</span><br>
             what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they <br>
             had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you <br>
             would have to think of them in a different way with different <br>
             coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches <br>
             and different kinds of hats.<span class="tag lineNumber">11455</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran <br>
             through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant <br>
             of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the <br>

             Father Dolan's whitegrey not young face, his baldy whitegrey <br>

             the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted <br>
             to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud <br>
             crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple to- <br>
             together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain <br>
             scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was <span class="tag lineNumber">11535</span><br>
             shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled <br>
             burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry <br>
             sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears <br>
             scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he <br>
             held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat. <span class="tag lineNumber">11540</span><br>

             shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in <br>
             terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with <br>
             a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry <span class="tag lineNumber">11550</span><br>
             come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his <br>

             knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning <br>
             tingling pain pressed in to his sides, he thought of the hands <br>

             firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the <br>
             shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of <br>
             palm and fingers that shook helplessly  in the air. <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Dolan</span>―Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  The door closed behind him.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father <br>
             Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the <span class="tag lineNumber">11570</span><br>
             boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had <br>
             made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to <br>
             his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―You may return to your places, you two. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat <span class="tag lineNumber">11575</span><br>
             down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly <br>
             with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to <br>
             the page.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  It was unfair and cruel: because the doctor had told him not <br>
             to read without glasses and he had written home to his father <span class="tag lineNumber">11580</span><br>
             that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had <br>
             said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to <br>
             be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he <br>
             always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the <br>
             Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a <span class="tag lineNumber">11585</span><br>
             trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had <br>
             steadied his hand and at first he had thought that he was going <br>
             to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: <br>
             but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane <br>
             sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel <span class="tag lineNumber">11590</span><br>
             in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them <br>
             both that they might return to their places without making any <br>
             difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low <br>
             and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was <br>
             sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. <span class="tag lineNumber">11595</span><br>
             The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and <br>
             unfair. And his whitegrey face and the nocoloured eyes behind <br>
             the steelrimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had <br>
             steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel: and, as he sat in the <br>
             refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same hu- <br>
             humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really <br>
             be that there was something in his face which made him look <span class="tag lineNumber">11630</span><br>
             like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But <br>
             there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on <br>
             Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the <br>
             spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He <span class="tag lineNumber">11635</span><br>
             would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly <br>
             punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody <br>
             in history, by some great person whose head was in the books <br>
             of history. And the rector would declare that he had been <br>
             wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people <span class="tag lineNumber">11640</span><br>
             always declared that the man who did that had been wrongly <br>
             punished. Those were the great men whose names were in <br>
             Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men <br>
             and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about <br>
             Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on <span class="tag lineNumber">11645</span><br>
             the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with <br>
             grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad <br>
             hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walk- <br>
             ing fast along the road to <span class="hide">39.074208 21.824312</span>Greece and <br>
            <span class="hide">41.902783 12.496366</span>Rome.</p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do  was when <span class="tag lineNumber">11650</span><br>
             the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on <br>
             walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the <br>
             right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to <br>
             turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a <br>
             minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led <span class="tag lineNumber">11655</span><br>
             through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had <br>
             said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of gram- <br>
             mar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line <br>
             stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as <span class="tag lineNumber">11660</span><br>
             they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee <br>
             and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big <br>
             Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That <br>
             was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and <br>
             pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired <span class="tag lineNumber">11665</span><br>
             with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and <br>
             big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done <br>
             something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: <br>
             and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He <br>
             had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured bogwater in the <span class="tag lineNumber">11670</span><br>
             shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his <br>
             feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs <br>
             shook a little because he was fat.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still <br>
             passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there <span class="tag lineNumber">11675</span><br>
             was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But <br>
             he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of <br>
             studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect <br>
             of studies would come in every day the same only it would be <br>
             worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow <span class="tag lineNumber">11680</span><br>
             going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to <br>
             go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all <br>
             about it. No, it was best to forget all about it: and perhaps the <br>
             prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was <br>
             best to hide out of the way because when you were small and <span class="tag lineNumber">11685</span><br>
             young you could often escape that way.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed <br>
             out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming <br>
             near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go <br>
             up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for <span class="tag lineNumber">11690</span><br>
             that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the <br>
             fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going <br>
             up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He was walking down along the matting and he saw the <br>
             door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought <span class="tag lineNumber">11695</span><br>
             of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no- <br>
             nocoloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the <br>
             prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why <br>
             could he not remember the name when he was told the first <br>
             time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun <span class="tag lineNumber">11700</span><br>
             out of the name? The great men in the history had names like <br>
             that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that <br>
             he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it <br>
             was like the name of a woman that washed clothes.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He had reached the door and, turning quickly  to the right, <span class="tag lineNumber">11705</span><br>
             walked up the stairs: and, before he could make up his mind to <br>
             come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that <br>
             led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of <br>
             the corridor  he saw, without turning his head to look, that all <br>
             the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.<span class="tag lineNumber">11710</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little <br>
             doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He <br>
             peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and <br>
             thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and <br>
             his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not <span class="tag lineNumber">11715</span><br>
             see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and <br>
             great men of the order who were looking down on him silently <br>
             as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and <br>
             pointing to the words Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam in it, saint <br>
             Francis Xavier pointing to his chest, Lorenzo Ricci with his <span class="tag lineNumber">11720</span><br>
             berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the <br>
             three patrons of holy youth, saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint <br>
             Aloysius Gonzaga and blessed John Berchmans, all with young <br>
             faces because they died when they were young, and Father <br>
             Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.<span class="tag lineNumber">11725</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and <br>
             looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had <br>
             passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it <br>
             was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white <br>
             cloak of a marshal.<span class="tag lineNumber">11730</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He <br>
             asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant <br>
             pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he <br>
             went on to it and knocked.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and <span class="tag lineNumber">11735</span><br>
             his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Come in! <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for <br>
             the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and <br>
             pushed it open and went in.<span class="tag lineNumber">11740</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull <br>
             on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old <br>
             leather of chairs.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he <br>

             and at the rector's kindlooking face. <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Well, my little man, said the rector. What is it? <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  Then he smiled and said: <br>

             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the rector</span>―Quite right!</p> said the rector. <br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen swallowed down the thing again  and tried to keep <br>

            <p class="textParagraph">  The rector said: <br>

             the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air <br>
             the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops <br>
             of water in a fountain falling softly in the brimming bowl.<br> </p>

         

       

       
        
          <h2 class="heading">II</h2>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his out- <br>
          spoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke <br>
          in a little outhouse at the end of the garden. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tran- <br>
          quilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it <span class="tag lineNumber">20005</span><br>
          will be more salubrious.<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can <br>
          smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by <br>
          God.<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―It's very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and <span class="tag lineNumber">20010</span><br>
          mollifying.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his out- <br>
          house but not before he had creased and brushed scrupulously <br>
          his back hair and brushed and put on his tall hat. While he <br>
          smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his pipe were <span class="tag lineNumber">20015</span><br>
          just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, <br>
          as he called the reeking outhouse which he shared with the cat <br>
          and the garden tools, served him also as a soundingbox: and <br>
          every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite <br>
          songs: <span class="emph">O, twine me a bower</span> or <span class="emph">Blue eyes and golden hair</span> or <span class="tag lineNumber">20020</span><br>
          <span class="emph">The Groves of Blarney</span> while the grey and blue coils of smoke <br>
          rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle <br>
          Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was <br>
          a hale old man with a well tanned skin, rugged features and <span class="tag lineNumber">20025</span><br>
          white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between <br>
          the house in <span class="hide">53.293248, -6.180109</span>Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main <br>
          street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was <br>
          glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped <br>
          him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open <span class="tag lineNumber">20030</span><br>
          boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a hand- <br>
          ful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and <br>
          thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the <br>
          shopman smiled uneasily; and on Stephen's feigning reluctance <br>
          to take them, he would frown and say: <span class="tag lineNumber">20035</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Uncle Charles</span>―Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your <br>
          bowels.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  When the order list had been booked the two would go on <br>
          to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike <br>
          Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. <span class="tag lineNumber">20040</span><br>
          Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn <br>
          would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in <br>
          hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike <br>
          Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and <br>
          his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning <span class="tag lineNumber">20045</span><br>
          practice was over the trainer would make his comments and <br>
          sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so <br>
          comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes. A small ring of <br>
          wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch <br>
          him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down <span class="tag lineNumber">20050</span><br>
          again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had <br>
          heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best <br>
          runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often <br>
          glanced with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubblecovered <br>
          face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he <span class="tag lineNumber">20055</span><br>
          rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue <br>
          eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze <br>
          vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers <br>
          ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back <br>
          into the pouch.<span class="tag lineNumber">20060</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to <br>
          the chapel and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old <br>
          man would dip his hand and then sprinkle the water briskly <br>
          about Stephen's clothes and on the floor of the porch. While he <br>
          prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his <span class="tag lineNumber">20065</span><br>
          breath from a thumbblackened prayerbook wherein catch- <br>
          words were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen knelt at <br>
          his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often <br>
          wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps <br>
          he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy <span class="tag lineNumber">20070</span><br>
          death: or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a <br>
          part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took <br>
          their constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite <br>
          of his corns and often ten or twelve miles of the road were <span class="tag lineNumber">20075</span><br>
          covered. The little village of <span class="hide">53.287857, -6.203573</span>Stillorgan was the parting of the <br>
          ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin moun- <br>
          tains or along the <span class="hide">53.297702, -6.233964</span>Goatstown road and thence <br>
          into <span class="hide">53.289154, -6.243264</span>Dundrum,
          coming home by  <span class="hide">53.269979, -6.224923</span>Sandyford. Trudging along the road or <br>
          standing in some grimy wayside publichouse his elders spoke <span class="tag lineNumber">20080</span><br>
          constantly of the subjects nearest their hearts, of Irish politics, <br>
          of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of <br>
          which Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not under- <br>
          stand he said over and over to himself till he had learned them <br>
          by heart: and through them he had glimpses of the real world <span class="tag lineNumber">20085</span><br>
          about him. The hour when he too would take his part in the <br>
          life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret he began <br>
          to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the <br>
          nature of which he only dimly apprehended.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged <span class="tag lineNumber">20090</span><br>
          translation of <span class="emph">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>. The figure of that <br>
          dark avenger stood forth in his mind for whatever he had heard <br>
          or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible. At night he <br>
          built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island <br>
          cave out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue <span class="tag lineNumber">20095</span><br>
          paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in which choc- <br>
          olate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary <br>
          of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of <br>
           <span class="hide">43.295207, <br>
          5.364077</span>Marseilles, of sunny trellisses and of Mercedes. Outside <span class="hide">53.300907,
          -6.177049</span>Black-
           rock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small <span class="tag lineNumber">20100</span><br>
          whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rose- <br>
          bushes: and in this house, he told himself, another Mercedes <br>
          lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he <br>
          measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he <br>
          lived through a long train of adventures, marvellous as those in <span class="tag lineNumber">20105</span><br>
          the book itself, towards the close of which there appeared an <br>
          image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a <br>
          moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before <br>
          slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, <br>
          saying: <span class="tag lineNumber">20110</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Count of Monte Cristo</span>―Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and <br>
          founded with him a gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey <br>
          carried a whistle dangling from his buttonhole and a bicycle <br>
          lamp attached to his belt while the others had short sticks <span class="tag lineNumber">20115</span><br>
          thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of <br>
          Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and <br>
          thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel <br>
          with his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays <br>
          into the gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and <span class="tag lineNumber">20120</span><br>
          fought a battle on the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home <br>
          after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore <br>
          in their nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon their <br>
          hands and in their hair.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they <span class="tag lineNumber">20125</span><br>
          drove out in the milkcar to <span class="hide">53.250224, -6.179926</span>Carrickmines where the cows were <br>
          at grass. While the men were milking the boys would take turns <br>
          in riding the tractable mare round the field. But when autumn <br>
          came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first <br>
          sight of the filthy cowyard at <span class="hide">53.300791 -6.177067</span>Stradbrook with its foul green <span class="tag lineNumber">20130</span><br>
          puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs <br>
          sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so beau- <br>
          tiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could <br>
          not even look at the milk they yielded.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The coming of September did not trouble him this year for <span class="tag lineNumber">20135</span><br>
          he knew he was not to be sent back to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. The practice <br>
          in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospi- <br>
          tal. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in <br>
          the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more <br>
          nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went <span class="tag lineNumber">20140</span><br>
          round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these <br>
          chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard <br>
          and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cowhairs and hayseeds <br>
          on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a <br>
          house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen <span class="tag lineNumber">20145</span><br>
          or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would <br>
          hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it <br>
          should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every <br>
          evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of <br>
          gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowl- <span class="tag lineNumber">20150</span><br>
          edge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag <br>
          suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which <br>
          had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby <br>
          stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his long stained <br>
          fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he <span class="tag lineNumber">20155</span><br>
          understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the <br>
          reason why he himself had not been sent back to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. <br>
          For some time he had felt the slight changes in his house; and <br>
          these changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so <br>
          many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The <span class="tag lineNumber">20160</span><br>
          ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul <br>
          sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer world obscured <br>
          his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the <br>
          tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and <br>
          rattling behind him.<span class="tag lineNumber">20165</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her im- <br>
          age, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever <br>
          gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening <br>
          along the quiet avenues. The peace of the gardens and the <br>
          kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his <span class="tag lineNumber">20170</span><br>
          restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and <br>
          their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had <br>
          felt at <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did <br>
          not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the <br>
          unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He <span class="tag lineNumber">20175</span><br>
          did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which <br>
          led him on told him that this image would, without any overt <br>
          act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they <br>
          had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one <br>
          of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, <span class="tag lineNumber">20180</span><br>
          surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of <br>
          supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade <br>
          into something impalpable under her eyes and then, in a mo- <br>
          ment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and <br>
          inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.<span class="tag lineNumber">20185</span><br> </p>
          <div class="divider">* * *</div>
         
        
          <p class="textParagraph">   Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before <br>
          the door and men had come tramping into the house to dis- <br>
          mantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front <br>
          garden which was strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends <br>
          and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely <span class="tag lineNumber">20190</span><br>
          stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and from <br>
          the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with <br>
          his redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering heavily <br>
          along the Merrion Road.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Deda- <span class="tag lineNumber">20195</span><br>
          lus rested the poker against the bars of the grate to attract the <br>
          flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a corner of the half furnished <br>
          uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits leaned <br>
          against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over <br>
          the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the vanmen. Stephen <span class="tag lineNumber">20200</span><br>
          sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a long and <br>
          incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at <br>
          first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies <br>
          and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that <br>
          he was being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being <span class="tag lineNumber">20205</span><br>
          laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort <br>
          and revery of <span class="hide">53.300907, -6.177049</span>Blackrock, the passage through the gloomy foggy <br>
          city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were <br>
          now to live made his heart heavy: and again an intuition or <br>
          foreknowledge of the future came to him. He understood also <span class="tag lineNumber">20210</span><br>
          why the servants had often whispered together in the hall and <br>
          why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back <br>
          to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit <br>
          down and eat his dinner. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, <span class="tag lineNumber">20215</span><br>
          said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy. <br>
          We're not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive <br>
          me) nor half dead. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  <span class="hide">53.349307, -6.263654</span>Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles <br>
          had grown so witless that he could no longer be sent out on <span class="tag lineNumber">20220</span><br>
          errands and the disorder in settling in the new house left Ste- <br>
          phen freer than he had been in <span class="hide">53.300907, -6.177049</span>Blackrock. In the beginning he <br>
          contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring <br>
          square or, at most, going half way down one of the side streets: <br>
          but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his mind he <span class="tag lineNumber">20225</span><br>
          followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the <br>
          customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and <br>
          along the quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay <br>
          bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at <br>
          the crowds of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the <span class="tag lineNumber">20230</span><br>
          illdressed bearded policeman. The vastness and strangeness of <br>
          the life suggested to him by the bales of merchandise stacked <br>
          along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers <br>
          wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wan- <br>
          dering in the evening from garden to garden in search of <span class="tag lineNumber">20235</span><br>
          Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might have <br>
          fancied himself in another <span class="hide">43.295207, 5.364077</span>Marseilles but that he missed the <br>
          bright sky and the sunwarmed trellisses of the wineshops. A <br>
          vague dissatisfaction grew up within him as he looked on the <br>
          quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he <span class="tag lineNumber">20240</span><br>
          continued to wander up and down day after day as if he really <br>
          sought someone that eluded him.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He went once or twice with his mother to visit their rela- <br>
          tives: and, though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and <br>
          adorned for Christmas, his mood of embittered silence did not <span class="tag lineNumber">20245</span><br>
          leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many, remote <br>
          and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the <br>
          prey of restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of <br>
          fortune which was reshaping the world about him into a vision <br>
          of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent nothing to the <span class="tag lineNumber">20250</span><br>
          vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw, detaching <br>
          himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt's kitchen. A <br>
          lamp with a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fire- <br>
          place and by its light his aunt was reading the evening paper <span class="tag lineNumber">20255</span><br>
          that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a smiling <br>
          picture that was set in it and said musingly:<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">his aunt</span>―The beautiful Mabel Hunter!<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and <br>
          said softly: <span class="tag lineNumber">20260</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―What is she in, mud? <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl's mother</span>―In the pantomime, love. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother's <br>
          sleeve, gazing on the picture and murmured, as if fascinated: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―The beautiful Mabel Hunter! <span class="tag lineNumber">20265</span><br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely <br>
          taunting eyes and she murmured again devotedly: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">ringletted girl</span>―Isn't she an exquisite creature? <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crook- <br>
          edly under his stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his <span class="tag lineNumber">20270</span><br>
          load promptly on the floor and hurried to her side to see. But <br>
          she did not raise her easeful head to let him see. He mauled the <br>
          edges of the paper with his reddened and blackened hands, <br>
          shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the <span class="tag lineNumber">20275</span><br>
          old darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall <br>
          and beyond the window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the <br>
          river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making tea and, <br>
          as she bustled at her task, she told in a low voice of what the <br>
          priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes <span class="tag lineNumber">20280</span><br>
          that she had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and <br>
          sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways <br>
          of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and <br>
          winding galleries and jagged caverns.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A <span class="tag lineNumber">20285</span><br>
          skull appeared suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A <br>
          feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the <br>
          sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the <br>
          door, asking: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―Is that Josephine? <span class="tag lineNumber">20290</span><br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fire- <br>
          place: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">old woman</span>―No, Ellen. It's Stephen. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―O .... O, good evening, Stephen. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out <span class="tag lineNumber">20295</span><br>
          over the face in the doorway. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">old woman</span>―Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the <br>
          fire.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But she did not answer the question and said: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ellen</span>―I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, <span class="tag lineNumber">20300</span><br>
          Stephen.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He was sitting in the midst of a children's party at <span class="hide">53.324608, <br>
          -6.281580</span>Harold's
           Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he <br>
          took little part in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of <span class="tag lineNumber">20305</span><br>
          their crackers, danced and romped noisily and, though he tried <br>
          to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid <br>
          the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug <br>
          corner of the room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. <span class="tag lineNumber">20310</span><br>
          The mirth, which in the beginning of the evening had seemed <br>
          to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to him, passing <br>
          gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation <br>
          of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid <br>
          the music and laughter her glances travelled to his corner, <span class="tag lineNumber">20315</span><br>
          flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting <br>
          on their things: the party was over. She had thrown a shawl <br>
          about her and, as they went together towards the tram, sprays <br>
          of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and <span class="tag lineNumber">20320</span><br>
          her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and <br>
          shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor <br>
          tor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light <br>
          of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a <span class="tag lineNumber">20325</span><br>
          few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down <br>
          the road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the <br>
          lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their <br>
          bells.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the <span class="tag lineNumber">20330</span><br>
          lower. She came up to his step many times and went down to <br>
          hers again between their phrases and once or twice stood close <br>
          beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting to <br>
          go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her <br>
          movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes <span class="tag lineNumber">20335</span><br>
          said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim <br>
          past, whether in life or in revery, he had heard their tale before. <br>
          He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long <br>
          black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thou- <br>
          sand times. Yet a voice within him spoke above the noise of his <span class="tag lineNumber">20340</span><br>
          dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he <br>
          had only to stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day <br>
          when he and Eileen had stood looking into the hotel grounds, <br>
          watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on the <br>
          flagstaff and the foxterrier scampering to and fro on the sunny <span class="tag lineNumber">20345</span><br>
          lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal <br>
          of laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. <br>
          Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a <br>
          tranquil watcher of the scene before him.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> ―She too wants me to catch hold of her, he thought. That's <span class="tag lineNumber">20350</span><br>
          why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of <br>
          her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could <br>
          hold her and kiss her.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the <br>
          deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily <span class="tag lineNumber">20355</span><br>
          at the corrugated footboard.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for <br>
          many hours. Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and <br>
          a new emerald exercise. From force of habit he had written at <br>
          the top of the first page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: <span class="tag lineNumber">20360</span><br>
          A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the title of <br>
          the verses he was trying to write: To E-- C--. He knew it was <br>
          right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected <br>
          poems of Lord Byron. When he had written this title and <br>
          drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream <span class="tag lineNumber">20365</span><br>
          and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw <br>
          himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the dis- <br>
          cussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem <br>
          about Parnell on the back of one of his father's second moiety <br>
          notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the <span class="tag lineNumber">20370</span><br>
          theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names <br>
          and addresses of certain of his classmates: <br>
           Roderick Kickham <br>
          John Lawton <br>
          Anthony MacSwiney <span class="tag lineNumber">20375</span><br>
          Simon Moonan<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of <br>
          brooding on the incident, he thought himself into confidence. <br>
          During this process all those elements which he deemed com- <br>
          mon and insignificant fell out of the scene. There remained no <span class="tag lineNumber">20380</span><br>
          trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen nor of the horses: <br>
          nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the <br>
          night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. <br>
          Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the protag- <br>
          onists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees and <span class="tag lineNumber">20385</span><br>
          when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had <br>
          been withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters <br>
          L. D. S. were written at the foot of the page and, having hidden <br>
          the book, he went into his mother's bedroom and gazed at his <br>
          face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.<span class="tag lineNumber">20390</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its <br>
          end. One evening his father came home full of news which kept <br>
          his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting <br>
          his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and <br>
          he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the <span class="tag lineNumber">20395</span><br>
          gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of <br>
           <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust. <br>

          <p class="textParagraph">  The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen <br>
          from the window of the dressingroom looked out on  the small <br>
          grassplot across which lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. <br>
          He watched the visitors come down the steps from the house <br>
          and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belve- <span class="tag lineNumber">20460</span><br>
          dereans, loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre <br>
          and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the sudden <br>

          <p class="textParagraph">  The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the taber- <br>

          the dais of the altar and the space before it free. Against the <br>
          walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs; the dumb- <br>
          bells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless <br>
          hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in <br>
          untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed <span class="tag lineNumber">20470</span><br>
          vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on to the stage. <br>
          A large bronze shield, tipped with silver, leaned against the <br>

          farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his <span class="tag lineNumber">20480</span><br>
          stature and grave manners for he was now at the end of his <br>
          second year at Belvedere and in number two.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets <br>
          came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and <br>
          into the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager <span class="tag lineNumber">20485</span><br>
          masters and boys. The plump bald sergeantmajor was testing <br>
          with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean <br>
          young man in a long overcoat, who was to give a special <br>
          display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with <br>
          interest, his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deep side- <span class="tag lineNumber">20490</span><br>
          pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard <br>
          as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in <br>
          another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys <br>
          through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of <br>
          his soutane nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. <span class="tag lineNumber">20495</span><br>
          A little troop  of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps <br>
          at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their <br>
          heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsey- <br>
          ing. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar <br>
          a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she <span class="tag lineNumber">20500</span><br>
          stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and <br>
          an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eye- <br>
          brows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was dis- <br>
          covered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the <br>
          discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and <span class="tag lineNumber">20505</span><br>
          nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having <br>
          bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a prefect</span>―Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, <br>
          Mrs Tallon?<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face un- <span class="tag lineNumber">20510</span><br>
          der the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a prefect</span>―No! Upon my word I believe it's little Bertie Tallon after all! <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and <br>
          the priest laugh together and heard the boys' murmur of ad- <br>
          miration behind him as they pressed forward to see the little <span class="tag lineNumber">20515</span><br>
          boy who had to dance the sunbonnet dance by himself. A <br>
          movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the <br>
          blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had <br>
          been standing, walked out of the chapel.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed <span class="tag lineNumber">20520</span><br>
          that flanked the garden. From the theatre opposite came the <br>
          muffled noise of the audience and sudden brazen clashes of the <br>
          soldiers' band. The light spread upwards from the glass roof <br>
          making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks <br>
          of houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moor- <span class="tag lineNumber">20525</span><br>
          ings. A sidedoor of the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of <br>
          light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of music issued <br>
          from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the sidedoor <br>
          closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the <br>
          music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and <span class="tag lineNumber">20530</span><br>
          supple movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which <br>
          had been the cause of all his day's unrest and of his impatient <br>
          movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like <br>
          a wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was <br>
          journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a <span class="tag lineNumber">20535</span><br>
          noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It was the <br>
          clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the <br>
          stage.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink <br>
          light showed in the darkness and as he walked towards it he <span class="tag lineNumber">20540</span><br>
          became aware of a faint aromatic odour. Two boys were <br>
          standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before he <br>
          reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Here comes the noble Dedalus!</p> cried a high throaty voice. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">heron</span>Welcome to our trusty friend! <span class="tag lineNumber">20545</span><br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as <br>
          Heron salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his <br>
          cane. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Here I am</p>, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to <br>
          his friend. <span class="tag lineNumber">20550</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the <br>
          aid of the glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale <br>
          dandyish face, over which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall <br>
          overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did not trouble him- <br>
          self about an introduction but said instead: <span class="tag lineNumber">20555</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be <br>
          tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the school- <br>
          master. It would be a ripping good joke. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis <br>
          the rector's pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, <span class="tag lineNumber">20560</span><br>
          asked Stephen to do it. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Go on, Dedalus</p>, he urged. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>You can take him off rippingly.</p><br>
          <p class="lg">
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>He that will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as the <br>
          heathena and the publicana.</p><br>
          </p></p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger <span class="tag lineNumber">20565</span><br>
          from Wallis in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too <br>
          tightly wedged. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wallis</span>―Damn this blankety blank holder</p>, he said, taking it from his <br>
          mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wallis</span>It's always <br>
          getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? <span class="tag lineNumber">20570</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I don't smoke, answered Stephen. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―No,</p> said Heron, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't <br>
          smoke and he doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he <br>
          doesn't damn anything or damn all. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and <span class="tag lineNumber">20575</span><br>
          mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it <br>
          strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's <br>
          name. A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled <br>
          crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked <br>
          nose stood out between the closeset prominent eyes which were <span class="tag lineNumber">20580</span><br>
          light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat <br>
          together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together <br>
          after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one <br>
          were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had been <br>
          during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who <span class="tag lineNumber">20585</span><br>
          went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a <br>
          fellow off. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―O by the way</p>, said Heron suddenly, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>I saw your governor <br>
          going in. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his <span class="tag lineNumber">20590</span><br>
          father by a fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a <br>
          moment. He waited in timorous silence to hear what Heron <br>
          might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with <br>
          his elbow and said: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―You're a sly dog, Dedalus! <span class="tag lineNumber">20595</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Why so?</p> said Stephen. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth</p>, said <br>
           Heron. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>But I'm afraid you're a sly dog. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Might I ask you what you are talking about?</p> said Stephen <br>
          urbanely.<span class="tag lineNumber">20600</span><br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Indeed  you might</p>, answered Heron. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>&gt;We saw her, Wallis, <br>
          didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And so inquisitive! <br>
          <span class="emph">And what part does Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will <br>
          Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</span> Your governor was staring at <br>
          her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I <span class="tag lineNumber">20605</span><br>
          think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, <br>
          by Jove. She's  ripping, isn't she, Wallis? <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Wallis</span>―Not half bad</p>, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his <br>
          holder once more in a corner of his mouth. <br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at <span class="tag lineNumber">20610</span><br>
          these indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him <br>
          there was nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All <br>
          day he had thought of nothing but their leavetaking on the <br>
          steps of the tram at <span class="hide">53.324608, -6.281580</span>Harold's Cross, the stream of moody <br>
          emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he <span class="tag lineNumber">20615</span><br>
          had written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting <br>
          with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old <br>
          restless moodiness had again filled his heart as it had done on <br>
          the night of the party but had not found  an outlet in verse. The <br>
          growth and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between <span class="tag lineNumber">20620</span><br>
          then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream <br>
          of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and re- <br>
          turned upon itself in dark courses and eddies, wearying him in <br>
          the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little <br>
          boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience. <span class="tag lineNumber">20625</span><br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―So you may as well admit</p>, Heron went on, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>that we've fairly <br>
          found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any <br>
          more, that's one sure five. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, <br>
          bending down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the <span class="tag lineNumber">20630</span><br>
          calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was nei- <br>
          ther flattered nor confused but simply wished the banter to <br>
          end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him at first a <br>
          silly indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind <span class="tag lineNumber">20635</span><br>
          stood in no danger from their words: and his face mirrored his <br>
          rival's false smile. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit!</p> repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane <br>
          across the calf of the leg. <br></p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first <span class="tag lineNumber">20640</span><br>
          one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and <br>
          almost painlessly; and bowing submissively, as if to meet his <br>
          companion's jesting mood, began to recite the Confiteor. The <br>
          episode ended well for both Heron and Wallis laughed indul- <br>
          gently at the irreverence.<span class="tag lineNumber">20645</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while <br>
          they spoke the words, a sudden memory had carried him to <br>
          another scene called up, as if by magic, at the moment when he <br>
          had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of Heron's <br>
          smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against <span class="tag lineNumber">20650</span><br>
          his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition: <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Admit!<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  It was towards the close of his first term in the college when <br>
          he was in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting <br>
          under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His <span class="tag lineNumber">20655</span><br>
          soul was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenom- <br>
          enon of <span class="hide">53.349307, -6.263654</span>Dublin. He had emerged from a two years' spell of <br>
          revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event <br>
          and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened him <br>
          or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled <span class="tag lineNumber">20660</span><br>
          him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure that <br>
          his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive <br>
          writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in <br>
          his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every <span class="tag lineNumber">20665</span><br>
          Tuesday, as he marched from home to the school, he read his <br>
          fate in the incidents of the way, pitting himself against some <br>
          figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to outstrip it be- <br>
          fore a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupu- <br>
          lously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath and <span class="tag lineNumber">20670</span><br>
          telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly <br>
          essay.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely <br>
          broken. Mr Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him <br>
          and said bluntly: <span class="tag lineNumber">20675</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―This fellow has heresy in his essay. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug <br>
          with his hand between his crossed thighs while his heavily <br>
          starched linen creaked about his neck and wrists. Stephen did <br>
          not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were still <span class="tag lineNumber">20680</span><br>
          smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detec- <br>
          tion, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against <br>
          his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―Perhaps you didn't know that</p>, he said. <span class="tag lineNumber">20685</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Where?</p> asked Stephen. <br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the es- <br>
          say. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm ... rrm ..... <br>
          rrm ...  Ah! <span class="emph">without a possibility of ever approaching nearer</span>. <span class="tag lineNumber">20690</span><br>
          That's heresy. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen murmured: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I meant <span class="emph">without a possibility of ever reaching</span>. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the <br>
          essay and passed it across to him, saying: <span class="tag lineNumber">20695</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mr Tate</span>―O ... Ah! <span class="emph">ever reaching</span>. That's another story. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody <br>
          spoke to him of the affair after class he could feel about him a <br>
          vague general malignant joy.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A few nights after this public chiding  he was walking with a <span class="tag lineNumber">20700</span><br>
          letter along the <span class="hide">53.36324, -6.25800</span>Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Halt! <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming to- <br>
          wards him in the dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, <br>
          as he marched forward between his two attendants, he cleft the <span class="tag lineNumber">20705</span><br>
          air before him with a thin cane, in time to their steps. Boland, <br>
          his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while <br>
          Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and <br>
          wagging his great red head.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  As soon as the boys had turned into <span class="hide">53.362304, -6.249867</span>Clonliffe Roadtogether <span class="tag lineNumber">20710</span><br>
          they began to speak about books and writers, saying what <br>
          books they were reading and how many books there were in <br>
          their fathers' bookcases at home. Stephen listened to them in <br>
          some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler <br>
          of the class. In fact after some talk about their favourite writers <span class="tag lineNumber">20715</span><br>
          Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the <br>
          greatest writer. <br>

          at him, while he, }omit{ half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clench- <span class="tag lineNumber">20790</span><br>

          <p class="textParagraph">  While he was still repeating the Confiteor amid the indul- <br>

          his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those <span class="tag lineNumber">20795</span><br>
          who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their <br>
          cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no <br>
          anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred <br>
          which he had met in books had  seemed to him therefore unreal. <br>
          Even that night as he stumbled homewards along <span class="hide">53.360891, -6.251230</span>Jones's Road <span class="tag lineNumber">20800</span><br>
          he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden- <br>
          woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her soft ripe peel.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He remained standing with his two companions at the end <br>
          of the shed, listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of <br>
          applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others, <span class="tag lineNumber">20805</span><br>
          perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her ap- <br>
          pearance but could not. He could remember only that she had <br>
          worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes <br>
          had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her <br>
          thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and unseen <span class="tag lineNumber">20810</span><br>
          by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand <br>
          upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it and yet <br>
          pressing upon it lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had <br>
          been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their <br>
          touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm <span class="tag lineNumber">20815</span><br>
          wave.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. <br>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is in a great bake about you. <br>

          you better. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―He's coming now, said Heron to the messenger with a <br>
          haughty drawl, when he wants to. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The boy turned to Heron and repeated: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―But Doyle is in an awful bake. <span class="tag lineNumber">20825</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned <br>
          his eyes? answered Heron. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Well, I must go now, said Stephen who cared little for such <br>
          points of honour. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Heron</span>―I wouldn't, said Heron, damn me if I would. That's no way <span class="tag lineNumber">20830</span><br>
          to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed! I think it's <br>
          quite enough that you're taking a part in his bally old play. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had ob- <br>
          served lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his <br>
          habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and <span class="tag lineNumber">20835</span><br>
          doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to <br>
          him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour <br>
          here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his <br>
          mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in <br>
          irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the <span class="tag lineNumber">20840</span><br>
          constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to <br>
          be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good <br>
          catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be <br>
          hollowsounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been <br>
          opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and <span class="tag lineNumber">20845</span><br>
          manly and healthy and when the movement towards national <br>
          revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had <br>
          bidden him  be true to his country and help to raise up her <br>
          fallen language and tradition. In the profane world, as he <br>
          foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's <span class="tag lineNumber">20850</span><br>
          fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his <br>
          schoolcomrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield <br>
          others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get <br>
          free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow- <br>
          sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit <span class="tag lineNumber">20855</span><br>
          of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was <br>
          happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, <br>
          alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  In the vestry a plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man, in <br>
          shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and <span class="tag lineNumber">20860</span><br>
          chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood <br>
          still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with <br>
          their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young <br>
          jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking <br>
          himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and <span class="tag lineNumber">20865</span><br>
          back again, his hands thrust well forward into his sidepockets. <br>
          His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly <br>
          shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane <br>
          and with his spotless shoes.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for him- <span class="tag lineNumber">20870</span><br>
          self the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into <br>
          Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father <br>
          before he had been sent to <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes, that you could always <br>
          tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he <br>
          thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of <span class="tag lineNumber">20875</span><br>
          this smiling welldressed priest: and he was aware of some des- <br>
          ecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself, whose si- <br>
          lence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air <br>
          pungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted <span class="tag lineNumber">20880</span><br>
          black and blue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the <br>
          voice of the plump young jesuit which bade him speak up and <br>
          make his points clearly. He could hear the band playing <span class="emph">The <br>
          Lily of Killarney</span> and knew that in a few moments the curtain <br>
          would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part <span class="tag lineNumber">20885</span><br>
          he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance  of some of his <br>
          lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He saw her <br>
          serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience <br>
          and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his <br>
          will compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: <span class="tag lineNumber">20890</span><br>
          the infection of the excitement and youth about him entered <br>
          into and transformed his moody mistrustfulness. For one rare <br>
          moment he seemed to be clothed in the real apparel of boy- <br>
          hood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he <br>
          shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was <span class="tag lineNumber">20895</span><br>
          hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks <br>
          and all awry.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the <br>
          garish gas and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable <br>
          faces of the void. It surprised him to see that the play which he <span class="tag lineNumber">20900</span><br>
          had known at rehearsals for a disjointed lifeless thing had <br>
          suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play itself, <br>
          he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the <br>
          curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with <br>
          applause and, through a rift in the side scene, saw the simple <span class="tag lineNumber">20905</span><br>
          body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void <br>
          of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy <br>
          groups.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery <br>
          and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. <span class="tag lineNumber">20910</span><br>
          Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further <br>
          adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors <br>
          of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. <br>
          On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few <br>
          lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He <span class="tag lineNumber">20915</span><br>
          mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some <br>
          prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the <br>
          crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching <br>
          the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He <br>
          pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and <span class="tag lineNumber">20920</span><br>
          faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his <br>
          powdered head left in its wake.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for <br>
          him at the first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of <br>
          the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily. <span class="tag lineNumber">20925</span><br></p>
          <p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I have to leave a message down in George's Street,</p> he said to <br>

          <p class="textParagraph">  Without waiting for his father's questions  he ran across the <br>
          road and began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He <br>
          hardly knew where he was walking. Pride and hope and desire <span class="tag lineNumber">20930</span><br>
          like crushed herbs in his heart sent up vapours of maddening <br>
          incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the hill <br>
          amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded pride and <br>
          fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before <br>
          his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed <span class="tag lineNumber">20935</span><br>
          away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A <br>
          power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment <br>
          fall from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and <br>
          gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to <span class="tag lineNumber">20940</span><br>
          the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <span class="emph">Lotts</span> on <br>
          the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> ―That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good <br>

          of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his <br>

          the station he recalled his childish wonder of years before and <br>
          every event of his first day at <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. But he felt no wonder <span class="tag lineNumber">20950</span><br>
          now. He saw the darkening lands slipping past him, the silent <br>
          telegraphpoles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, <br>
          the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, <br>
          flung by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the <br>
          darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.<span class="tag lineNumber">20955</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He listened without sympathy to his father's evocation of <br>
          Cork and of scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or <br>
          draughts from his pocket flask whenever the image of some <br>
          dead friend appeared in it or whenever the evoker remembered <br>
          suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen heard but <span class="tag lineNumber">20960</span><br>
          could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strange to <br>
          him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been <br>
          fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father's <br>
          property was going to be sold by auction and in the manner of <br>
          his own dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his <span class="tag lineNumber">20965</span><br>
          phantasy.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train <br>
          had passed out of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep <br>
          on the other seat. The cold light of the dawn lay over the <br>
          country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed cottages. The <span class="tag lineNumber">20970</span><br>
          terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent <br>
          country or heard from time to time his father's deep breath or <br>
          sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen <br>
          sleepers filled him with strange dread as though they could <br>
          harm him; and he prayed that the day might come quickly. His <span class="tag lineNumber">20975</span><br>
          prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with a shiver, <br>
          as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the <br>
          carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words <br>
          which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of the train: and <br>
          silently, at intervals of four seconds, the telegraphpoles held the <span class="tag lineNumber">20980</span><br>
          galloping notes of the music between punctual bars. This furi- <br>
          ous music allayed his dread and, leaning against the window- <br>
          ledge, he let his eyelids close again.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early <br>
          morning and Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the <span class="tag lineNumber">20985</span><br>
          Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight was streaming <br>
          through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His <br>
          father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his <br>
          hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his neck <br>
          across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the <span class="tag lineNumber">20990</span><br>
          better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint <br>
          accent and phrasing: <br>

          festooned the strange sad happy air drove off all the mists of <br>
          the night's ill humour from Stephen's brain. He got up quickly <br>
          to dress and, when the song had ended, said: <br>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―It's a pretty old air, said Mr Dedalus, twirling the points of <br>
          his moustache. Ah, but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing <br>

          used to put in that I haven't got. That was the boy }omit{ could sing a <span class="tag lineNumber">21020</span><br>
          <span class="emph">come-all-you</span>, if you like. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during <br>
          the meal he crossexamined the waiter for local news. For the <br>
          most part they spoke at cross purposes when a name was <br>
          mentioned, the waiter having in mind its present holder and Mr <span class="tag lineNumber">21025</span><br>
          Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College any- <br>
          how, said Mr Dedalus, for I want to show it to this youngster <br>

          <p class="textParagraph">  Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered <span class="tag lineNumber">21030</span><br>
          the grounds of the college and were led by the garrulous porter <br>
          across the quadrangle. But their progress across the gravel was <br>
          brought to a halt after  every dozen or so paces by some reply of <br>
          the porter's. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? <span class="tag lineNumber">21035</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">porter</span>―Yes, sir. Dead, sir. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two <br>
          men, weary of the subject and waiting restlessly for the slow <br>
          march to begin again. By the time they had crossed the quad- <br>
          rangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered how his <span class="tag lineNumber">21040</span><br>
          father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be <br>
          duped by the servile manners of the porter: and the lively <br>
          southern speech which had entertained him all the morning <br>
          now irritated his ears.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, <span class="tag lineNumber">21045</span><br>
          the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Ste- <br>
          phen remained in the background, depressed more than ever by <br>
          the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of <br>
          jaded and formal study. On the desk before him he read the <br>
          word <span class="emph">Foetus</span>  cut several times in the dark stained wood. The <span class="tag lineNumber">21050</span><br>
          sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent <br>
          students of the college about him and to shrink from their <br>
          company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had <br>
          been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word <br>
          cut in the desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache <span class="tag lineNumber">21055</span><br>
          was cutting in the letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other <br>
          students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One <br>
          jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He <br>
          was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's name was called. He hurried down the steps of the <span class="tag lineNumber">21060</span><br>
          theatre so as to be as far away from the vision as he could be <br>
          and, peering closely at his father's initials, hid his flushed face.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he <br>
          walked back across the quadrangle and towards the college <br>
          gate. It shocked him to find in the outer world a trace of what <span class="tag lineNumber">21065</span><br>
          he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of his <br>
          own mind. His recent monstrous reveries came thronging into <br>
          his memory. They too had sprung up before him, suddenly and <br>
          furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them and <br>
          allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wonder- <span class="tag lineNumber">21070</span><br>
          ing always where they came from, from what den of monstrous <br>
          images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless <br>
          and sickened of himself when they had swept over him. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr <br>
          Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't <span class="tag lineNumber">21075</span><br>
          you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our <br>
          names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little <br>
          Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the <br>
          Frenchman, and Tom O'Grady and Mick Lacy that I told you <br>
          of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted <span class="tag lineNumber">21080</span><br>
          Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and <br>
          whispering in the sunlight. A team of cricketers passed, agile <br>
          young men in flannels and blazers, one of them carrying the <br>
          long green wicketbag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five <span class="tag lineNumber">21085</span><br>
          players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments <br>
          was playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely mess- <br>
          enger boys. A maid in a white cap and apron was watering a <br>
          box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of limestone in <br>
          the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the <span class="tag lineNumber">21090</span><br>
          sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen walked on at his father's side, listening to stories he <br>
          had heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and <br>
          dead revellers who had been the companions of his father's <br>
          youth. And a faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his <span class="tag lineNumber">21095</span><br>
          own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid <br>
          of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, bat- <br>
          tling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his <br>
          mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared <br>
          upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms <span class="tag lineNumber">21100</span><br>
          and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy <br>
          orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow <br>
          and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment <br>
          he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He could still hear his father's voice. <span class="tag lineNumber">21105</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, }omit{ (as I daresay you <br>

          do something. One fellow had a good voice, another fellow <span class="tag lineNumber">21110</span><br>
          was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, an- <br>
          other was a good oarsman or a good racketplayer, another <br>
          could tell a good story and so on. We kept the ball rolling <br>
          anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we <br>
          were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, <span class="tag lineNumber">21115</span><br>

          Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellows I want you to associate <br>
          with, fellows of the right kidney. I'm talking to you as a friend, <br>
          Stephen. I don't believe in playing the stern father. I don't <br>
          believe a son should be afraid of his father. No, I treat you as <span class="tag lineNumber">21120</span><br>
          your grandfather treated me when I was a young chap. We <br>
          were more like brothers than father and son. I'll never forget <br>
          the first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end <br>
          of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself <br>
          and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had <span class="tag lineNumber">21125</span><br>
          pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the gov- <br>
          ernor passed. He didn't say a word or stop even. But the next <br>
          day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we <br>
          were coming home he took out his cigar case and said: <span class="emph">By the <br>
          bye, Simon, I didn't know you smoked:</span> or something like that. <span class="tag lineNumber">21130</span><br>
          – Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could. <span class="emph">If you want a <br>
          good smoke</span>, he said, <span class="emph">try one of these cigars. An American <br>
          captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown</span>. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen heard his father's voice break into a laugh which <br>
          was almost a sob. <span class="tag lineNumber">21135</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he <br>
          was! The women used to stand to look after him in the street. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat <br>
          and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight <br>
          breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a <span class="tag lineNumber">21140</span><br>
          fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of dark <br>
          rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could <br>
          scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By <br>
          his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself be- <br>
          yond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him <span class="tag lineNumber">21145</span><br>
          from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the <br>
          infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or <br>
          human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and <br>
          gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his fa- <br>
          ther's voice. He could scarcely recognise as his his own <span class="tag lineNumber">21150</span><br>
          thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> ―I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose <br>
          name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a <br>
          city. Our room is in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen <br>
          and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names.<span class="tag lineNumber">21155</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried <br>
          to call forth some of its vivid moments but could not. He <br>
          recalled only names: Dante, Parnell, Clane, <span class="hide">53.310770, -6.684719</span>Clongowes. A little <br>
          boy had been taught geography by an old woman who kept <br>
          two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away <span class="tag lineNumber">21160</span><br>
          from home to a college. In the college he had made his first <br>
          communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket cap and <br>
          watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little <br>
          bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being dead, of mass <br>
          being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of <span class="tag lineNumber">21165</span><br>
          being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off <br>
          the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then. Parnell had <br>
          died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no <br>
          procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in <br>
          the sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for <span class="tag lineNumber">21170</span><br>
          he no longer existed. How strange to think of him passing out <br>
          of existence in such a way, not by death but by fading out in <br>
          the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the uni- <br>
          verse! It was strange to see his small body appear again for a <br>
          moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His hands were in his <span class="tag lineNumber">21175</span><br>
          sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the  knees by <br>
          elastic bands.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  On the evening of the day on which the property was sold <br>
          Stephen followed his father meekly about the city from bar to <br>
          bar. To the sellers in the market, to the barmen and barmaids, <span class="tag lineNumber">21180</span><br>
          to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr Dedalus told <br>
          the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been <br>
          trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin <br>
          and that Peter Pickackafox beside him was his eldest son but <br>
          that he was only a Dublin jackeen.<span class="tag lineNumber">21185</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe's <br>
          coffeehouse where Mr Dedalus' cup had rattled noisily against <br>
          its saucer and Stephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of <br>
          his father's drinkingbout of the night before by moving his <br>
          chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another: <span class="tag lineNumber">21190</span><br>
          the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvettings and <br>
          oglings of the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the com- <br>
          pliments and encouraging words of his father's friends. They <br>
          had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather and <br>
          Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had <span class="tag lineNumber">21195</span><br>
          unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him <br>
          admit that the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One <br>
          of them in order to put his Latin to the proof had made him <br>
          translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him whether <br>
          it was correct to say: Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis <span class="tag lineNumber">21200</span><br>
          or Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis. Another, a brisk <br>
          old man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had <br>
          covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were <br>
          prettier, the Dublin girls or the Cork girls. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―He's not that way built, said Mr Dedalus. Leave him alone. <span class="tag lineNumber">21205</span><br>
          He's a levelheaded thinking boy who doesn't bother his head <br>
          about that kind of nonsense. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Then he's not his father's son, said the little old man. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―I don't know, I'm sure, said Mr Dedalus, smiling com- <br>
          placently.<span class="tag lineNumber">21210</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Your father, said the little old man to Stephen, was the <br>
          boldest flirt in the city of Cork in his day. Do you know that? <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar <br>
          into which they had drifted. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Now don't be putting ideas into his head, said Mr Dedalus. <span class="tag lineNumber">21215</span><br>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Yerra, sure I wouldn't put any ideas into his head. I'm old <br>
          enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather, said the <br>
          little old man to Stephen. Do you know that? <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Are you? asked Stephen. <span class="tag lineNumber">21220</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Bedad I am, said the little old man. I have two bouncing <br>
          grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now then! What age do <br>
          you think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his <br>
          red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Ay, or thought of, said Mr Dedalus. <span class="tag lineNumber">21225</span><br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Bedad I did! repeated the little old man. And, more than <br>
          that, I can remember even your greatgrandfather, old John Ste- <br>
          phen Dedalus, and a fierce old fireeater he was. Now then! <br>
          There's a memory for you! <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">another of the company</span>―That's three generations - four generations, said another of <span class="tag lineNumber">21230</span><br>
          the company. Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the <br>
          century.<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―Well, I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man. I'm just <br>
          twentyseven years of age. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―We're as old as we feel, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus. And just <span class="tag lineNumber">21235</span><br>
          finish what you have there and we'll have another. Here, Tim <br>
          or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. <br>
          By God, I don't feel more than eighteen myself. There's that <br>
          son of mine there not half my age and I'm a better man than he <br>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">another of the company</span>―Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it's about time for you to <br>
          take a back seat, said the gentleman who had spoken before. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―No, by God! asserted Mr Dedalus. I'll sing a tenor song <br>
          against him or I'll vault a fivebarred gate against him or I'll run <br>
          with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty <span class="tag lineNumber">21245</span><br>
          years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for it. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―But he'll beat you here, said the little old man, tapping his <br>
          forehead and raising his glass to drain it. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well, I hope he'll be as good a man as his father. That's all I <br>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">little old man</span>―If he is, he'll do, said the little old man. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―And thanks be to God, Johnny, said Mr Dedalus, that we <br>

          good.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the <br>
          counter as his father and his two cronies drank to the memory <br>
          of their past. An abyss of fortune or of temperament sundered <br>
          him from them. His mind seemed older than theirs: it shone <span class="tag lineNumber">21260</span><br>
          coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon <br>
          upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had <br>
          stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of compan- <br>
          ionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial <br>
          piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and <span class="tag lineNumber">21265</span><br>
          loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his <br>
          soul capable of simple joys: and he was drifting amid life like <br>
          the barren shell of the moon.<br> </p>

          <p class="textParagraph">  Stephen's mother and his brother and one of his cousins <br>
          waited at the corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his <br>
          father went up the steps and along the colonnade where the <br>
          highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into the <br>
          great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his <span class="tag lineNumber">21280</span><br>
          orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and <br>
          three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and <br>
          essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes <br>
          and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with <br>
          feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his <span class="tag lineNumber">21285</span><br>
          father chatted, to take his hand across the broad counter and <br>
          wish him a brilliant career in after life. He was impatient of <br>
          their voices and could not keep his feet at rest. But the teller <br>
          still deferred the serving of others to say that he was living in <br>
          changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the <span class="tag lineNumber">21290</span><br>
          best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in <br>
          the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling Ste- <br>
          phen, who urged him to come out, that they were standing in <br>
          the house of commons of the old Irish parliament. <br>
          <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―God help us!</p> he said piously. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>To think of the men of those <span class="tag lineNumber">21295</span><br>
          times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan <br>
          and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, <br>
          leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, <br>
          they wouldn't be seen dead in a ten acre field with them. No, <br>
          Stephen, old chap, I'm sorry to say that they are only as I roved <span class="tag lineNumber">21300</span><br>
          out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The <br>
          three figures standing at the edge of the muddy path had <br>
          pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly <br>
          clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had <span class="tag lineNumber">21305</span><br>
          seen a mantle priced at twenty guineas in the window of Bar- <br>
          nardo's. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Well that's done, said Mr Dedalus. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―We had better go to dinner, said Stephen. Where? <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. Well, I suppose we had better, <span class="tag lineNumber">21310</span><br>
          what?<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Some place that's not too dear, said Mrs Dedalus. <br> </p>

           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Mary Dedalus</span>―Yes. Some quiet place. <br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about <span class="tag lineNumber">21315</span><br>
          the dearness. <br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. <br>
          They tried to keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness. <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Simon Dedalus</span>―Take it easy like a good young fellow, said his father. We're <br>
          not out for the half mile, are we? <span class="tag lineNumber">21320</span><br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes <br>
          ran through Stephen's  fingers. Great parcels of groceries and <br>
          delicacies and dried fruits arrived from the city. Every day he <br>
          drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party <br>
          of three or four to the theatre to see <span class="emph">Ingomar</span> or <span class="emph">The Lady of <span class="tag lineNumber">21325</span><br>
          Lyons</span>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna choc- <br>
          olate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with <br>
          masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for <br>
          everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshal- <br>
          led his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds <span class="tag lineNumber">21330</span><br>
          of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the <br>
          household by which every member of it held some office, <br>
          opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing <br>
          borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out <br>
          receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he <span class="tag lineNumber">21335</span><br>
          could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. <br>
          Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink <br>
          enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom re- <br>
          mained with its unfinished and illplastered coat.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother <span class="tag lineNumber">21340</span><br>
          had no further occasion to upbraid him for squandering his <br>
          money. He too returned to his old life at school and all his <br>
          novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the <br>
          loan bank closed its coffers and its books on a sensible loss, the <br>
          rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desue- <span class="tag lineNumber">21345</span><br>
          tude.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a <br>
          breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life <br>
          without him and to dam up, by rules of conduct and active <br>
          interests and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the <span class="tag lineNumber">21350</span><br>
          tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the <br>
          waters had flowed over his barriers: their tides began once <br>
          more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone <br>
          one step nearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged <span class="tag lineNumber">21355</span><br>
          the restless shame and rancour that divided him from father <br>
          and mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was hardly <br>
          of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the <br>
          mystical kinship of fosterage, fosterchild and fosterbrother.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He burned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before <span class="tag lineNumber">21360</span><br>
          which everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he <br>
          was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of <br>
          subterfuges and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him <br>
          to realise the enormities which he brooded on nothing was <br>
          sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret <span class="tag lineNumber">21365</span><br>
          riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever im- <br>
          age had attracted his eyes. By day and by night he moved <br>
          among distorted images of the outer world. A figure that had <br>
          seemed to him by day demure and innocent  came towards him <br>
          by night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face trans- <span class="tag lineNumber">21370</span><br>
          figured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish <br>
          joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark <br>
          orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal even- <br>
          ings led him from street to street as they had led him years <span class="tag lineNumber">21375</span><br>
          before along the quiet avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of <br>
          trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the windows poured a <br>
          tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of <br>
          his desire, when the luxury that was wasting him gave room to <br>
          a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the back- <span class="tag lineNumber">21380</span><br>
          ground of his memory. He saw again the small white house and <br>
          the garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains <br>
          and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he <br>
          was to make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden <br>
          after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments <span class="tag lineNumber">21385</span><br>
          the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased <br>
          his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he <br>
          had then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality <br>
          which lay between his hope of then and now, of the holy <br>
          encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timid- <span class="tag lineNumber">21390</span><br>
          ity and inexperience were to fall from him.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up <br>
          again. The verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries <br>
          and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth from his brain to <br>
          force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up and <span class="tag lineNumber">21395</span><br>
          down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and <br>
          doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to him- <br>
          self like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with <br>
          another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and <br>
          to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving <span class="tag lineNumber">21400</span><br>
          irresistibly upon him from the  darkness, a presence subtle and <br>
          murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its mur- <br>
          mur besieged his ears like the murmur of some multitude in <br>
          sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His hands <br>
          clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered <span class="tag lineNumber">21405</span><br>
          the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the <br>
          street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and <br>
          incited him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his <br>
          throat issued from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of <br>
          despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of furious <span class="tag lineNumber">21410</span><br>
          entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was <br>
          but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the <br>
          oozing wall of a urinal.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. <br>
          From the foul laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and <span class="tag lineNumber">21415</span><br>
          wrangling and the drawling of drunken singers. He walked <br>
          onward, undismayed, wondering whether he had strayed into <br>
          the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid <br>
          gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were <br>
          leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes <span class="tag lineNumber">21420</span><br>
          grew dim. The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vi- <br>
          sion against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. <br>
          Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered, <br>
          arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had <br>
          awakened from a slumber of centuries.<span class="tag lineNumber">21425</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clam- <br>
          ouring against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed <br>
          in a long pink gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and <br>
          gazed into his face. She said gaily: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">prostitute</span>―Good night, Willie dear! <span class="tag lineNumber">21430</span><br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her <br>
          legs apart in the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to <br>
          bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching her <br>
          as she undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements <br>
          of her perfumed head.<span class="tag lineNumber">21435</span><br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over <br>
          to him and embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms <br>
          held him firmly to her and he, seeing her face lifted to him in <br>
          serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and fall of her <br>
          breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and <span class="tag lineNumber">21440</span><br>
          relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they <br>
          would not speak.<br> </p>

          firmly in her arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her <br>
          arms he felt that he had suddenly become strong and fearless <br>
          and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">  With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her <span class="tag lineNumber">21450</span><br>
          lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her <br>
          frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his <br>
          eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of <br>
          nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting <br>
          lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though <span class="tag lineNumber">21455</span><br>
          they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he <br>
          felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of <br>
          sin, softer than sound or odour.<br> </p>

          <p class="textParagraph"> The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after <br>
          its dull day and as he stared through the dull square of the <br>
          window of the schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food. <br>
          He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots <br>
          and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in <span class="tag lineNumber">30005</span><br>
          thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly <br>
          counselled him.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the <br>
          yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter <br>
          of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down <span class="tag lineNumber">30010</span><br>
          the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear <br>
          and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. <br>
          The whores would be just coming out of their houses making <br>
          ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling <br>
          the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them <span class="tag lineNumber">30015</span><br>
          calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a <br>
          sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. <br>
          Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses, stultified only <br>
          by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and shamed <br>
          them, his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a <span class="tag lineNumber">30020</span><br>
          photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy <br>
          playbill, his ears the drawling jargon of greeting: <br>

          <p class="textParagraph"> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread <br>
          out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's: and <br>
          when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated be- <br>
          gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing <span class="tag lineNumber">30030</span><br>
          and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes <br>
          opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. <br>
          The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its <br>
          verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying <br>
          him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer <span class="tag lineNumber">30035</span><br>
          and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment <br>
          upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. <br>
          The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell <br>
          through space.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an- <span class="tag lineNumber">30040</span><br>
          other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread <br>
          abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to <br>
          experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the <br>
          balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading <br>
          slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were <span class="tag lineNumber">30045</span><br>
          quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first <br>
          violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and <br>
          had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess. <br>
          Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of <span class="tag lineNumber">30050</span><br>
          himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or <br>
          soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established <br>
          between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished <br>
          itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had <br>
          sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, <span class="tag lineNumber">30055</span><br>
          while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin <br>
          alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his <br>
          punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no <br>
          atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having <br>
          ceased to refresh his soul. At most by an alms given to a <span class="tag lineNumber">30060</span><br>
          beggar, whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to <br>
          win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had <br>
          gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that <br>
          his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a <br>
          certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one <span class="tag lineNumber">30065</span><br>
          prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take <br>
          away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he <br>
          could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe <br>
          of God told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned <br>
          for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and <span class="tag lineNumber">30070</span><br>
          Allknowing. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a voice</span>―Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my <br>
          stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what <br>
          a surd is?<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of <span class="tag lineNumber">30075</span><br>
          his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On <br>
          Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced <br>
          coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, <br>
          outside the church, morally present at the mass which they <br>
          could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell <span class="tag lineNumber">30080</span><br>
          of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads <br>
          repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the <br>
          evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which <br>
          he could cajole so easily.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the <span class="tag lineNumber">30085</span><br>
          certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the <br>
          Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality <br>
          met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a <br>
          cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he <br>
          led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of <span class="tag lineNumber">30090</span><br>
          his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse <br>
          to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all <br>
          his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces <br>
          restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed <br>
          his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive: <span class="tag lineNumber">30095</span><br>
          spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the <br>
          preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol- <br>
          ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant <br>
          and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual <br>
          growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read <span class="tag lineNumber">30100</span><br>
          the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled <br>
          voice, lulling his conscience to its music:<br> </p>
          <p class="lg">
            <p class="textParagraph"> <span class="emph">Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu- <br>

          <p class="textParagraph"> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had <span class="tag lineNumber">30110</span><br>
          led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to <br>
          regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing <br>
          faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who <br>
          approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him <br>
          and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be <span class="tag lineNumber">30115</span><br>
          her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after <br>
          the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to- <br>
          wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <span class="emph">bright and</span> <br>
          <span class="emph">musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</span>, it was when her <br>
          names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin- <span class="tag lineNumber">30120</span><br>
          gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the <br>
          dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought. <br>
          The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done <br>
          for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began <span class="tag lineNumber">30125</span><br>
          to hum tunelessly:<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> <span class="emph">My excellent friend Bombados.</span> <br>
          <p class="textParagraph"> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Ennis</span>―The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.<br></p> </p>
          A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: <span class="tag lineNumber">30130</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a tall boy</span>―That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be <br>
          in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the <br>
          catechism, Dedalus.<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, <br>
          listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time <span class="tag lineNumber">30135</span><br>
          to time by saying: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Vincent Heron</span>―Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph">It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow- <br>
          ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church <br>
          and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the <span class="tag lineNumber">30140</span><br>
          more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint <br>
          James which says that he who offends against one command- <br>
          ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen <br>
          phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own <br>
          state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung <span class="tag lineNumber">30145</span><br>
          forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in <br>
          using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of <br>
          those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious <br>
          murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food, <br>
          the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his <span class="tag lineNumber">30150</span><br>
          longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his <br>
          whole being had sunk.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd <br>
          harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious <br>
          questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his <span class="tag lineNumber">30155</span><br>
          youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how <br>
          much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen <br>
          only or the pound together with the compound interest accru- <br>
          ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving <br>
          baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child <span class="tag lineNumber">30160</span><br>
          baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it <br>
          that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven <br>
          to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the <br>
          meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament <br>
          of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and <span class="tag lineNumber">30165</span><br>
          wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin- <br>
          ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny <br>
          particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and <br>
          blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If <br>
          the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into cor- <span class="tag lineNumber">30170</span><br>
          ruption after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still <br>
          present under their species as God and as man? <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a boy</span>―Here he is! Here he is!<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come <br>
          from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads <span class="tag lineNumber">30175</span><br>
          bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat <br>
          on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind <br>
          urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.<br> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson <br>
          from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said: <span class="tag lineNumber">30180</span><br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Conmee</span>―The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of <br>
          saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat <br>
          will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions <br>
          will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have <br>
          special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to <span class="tag lineNumber">30185</span><br>
          change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and <br>
          general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a <br>
          free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free <br>
          days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a <br>
          free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you, <span class="tag lineNumber">30190</span><br>
          Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.<br> </p>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Lawless</span>―I, sir? Why,  sir?<br></p> </p>
          <p class="textParagraph"> A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of <br>
          boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly <br>
          to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.<span class="tag lineNumber">30195</span><br> </p>

          Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an <br>
          old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he <br>
          was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in <span class="hide">48.853157 2.343094</span> <span class="tag lineNumber">30200</span><br>
          Paris where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the <br>
          university. This young and brilliant nobleman and man of let- <br>
          ters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious <br>
          founder and you know that he, at his own desire, was sent by <br>
          saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you <span class="tag lineNumber">30205</span><br>
          know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to <br>
          country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, <br>
          baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten <br>
          thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm <br>
          had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the <span class="tag lineNumber">30210</span><br>
          heads of those whom he baptised. He wished then to go to <br>
          China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on <br>
          the <span class="hide">21.705010 112.791206</span>island of Sancian. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A <br>

          <p class="textParagraph"> The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands be- <span class="tag lineNumber">30215</span><br>
          fore him, went on: <br>
           <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Conmee</span>―He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thou- <br>

          power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain what- <br>
          ever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power above <br>
          all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great <br>

            sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoul- <br>
            ders a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice <br>
            broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely <br>
            rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at <span class="hide">53.310624 -6.684096</span>Clongowes: <span class="tag lineNumber">30240</span><br>
            the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square ditch, <br>
            the little cemetery off the main avenue of limes where he had <br>
            dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the infirm- <br>
            ary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael. <br>
            His soul, as these memories came back to him, became again a <span class="tag lineNumber">30245</span><br>
            child's soul. <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in <br>
            Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of <br>
            the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest <br>
            of saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your <span class="tag lineNumber">30250</span><br>
            college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much longer <br>
            than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or than I <br>
            can remember the boys of this college have met in this very <br>
            chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their <br>
            patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its changes. <span class="tag lineNumber">30255</span><br>
            Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not <br>
            remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front benches a <br>
            few short years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in the <br>
            burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in sem- <br>
            inaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may <span class="tag lineNumber">30260</span><br>
            be, already called by the great God to another life and to the <br>
            rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years roll by, <br>
            bringing with them changes for good and bad, the memory of <br>
            the great saint is honoured by the boys of his college who make <br>
            every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast <span class="tag lineNumber">30265</span><br>
            day set apart by our holy mother  the church to transmit to all <br>
            the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of <br>
            catholic Spain.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now what is the meaning of this word <span class="emph">retreat</span> and why is it <br>
            allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who <span class="tag lineNumber">30270</span><br>
            desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly chris- <br>
            tian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal for a <br>
            while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday <br>
            world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to <br>
            reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand <span class="tag lineNumber">30275</span><br>
            better why we are here in this world. During these few days I <br>
            intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four <br>
            last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death, <br>
            judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them <br>
            fully during these few days so that we may derive from the <span class="tag lineNumber">30280</span><br>
            understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re- <br>
            member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world <br>
            for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will <br>
            and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing <br>
            alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit <span class="tag lineNumber">30285</span><br>
            a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his <br>
            immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in <br>
            this wretched world that can make up for such a loss.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from <br>
            your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts, <span class="tag lineNumber">30290</span><br>
            whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your <br>
            attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you <br>
            that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to <br>
            preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud <br>
            unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this <span class="tag lineNumber">30295</span><br>
            custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects and <br>
            officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the sodality <br>
            of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstu- <br>
            dents.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"><p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint <span class="tag lineNumber">30300</span><br>
            Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's bless- <br>
            ing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and <br>
            beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in <br>
            after years when maybe you are far from this college and <br>
            among very different surroundings, to which you can look back <span class="tag lineNumber">30305</span><br>
            with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having <br>
            granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a <br>
            pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so <br>
            happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul <br>
            which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy <span class="tag lineNumber">30310</span><br>
            grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that <br>
            this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I <br>
            pray to God  through the merits of His zealous servant Francis <br>
            Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and <br>
            that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may <span class="tag lineNumber">30315</span><br>
            be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and <br>
            unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem- <br>
            orable one.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your <br>
            pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward de- <span class="tag lineNumber">30320</span><br>
            meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and <br>
            think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven. <br>
            He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin <br>
            for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think <br>
            with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life and <span class="tag lineNumber">30325</span><br>
            die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has sacri- <br>
            ficed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a <br>
            hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the <br>
            kingdom without end – a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish <br>
            you from my heart; one and all, in the name of the Father and <span class="tag lineNumber">30330</span><br>
            of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog <br>
            seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it <br>
            should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner <br>
            with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the <span class="tag lineNumber">30335</span><br>
            greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and <br>
            went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth <br>
            with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to <br>
            the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the <br>
            end: and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his <span class="tag lineNumber">30340</span><br>
            mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and <br>
            gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and <br>
            that way through the dull light. And that was life. The letters <br>
            of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one <br>
            another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. <span class="tag lineNumber">30345</span><br>
            His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease, <br>
            plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening <br>
            dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon- <br>
            oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and <br>
            human for a bovine god to stare upon.<span class="tag lineNumber">30350</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul <br>
            slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be- <br>
            came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew <br>
            death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill <br>
            touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the <span class="tag lineNumber">30355</span><br>
            film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain <br>
            extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon <br>
            the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech <br>
            thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing <br>
            faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the <span class="tag lineNumber">30360</span><br>
            poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and <br>
            sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! <br>
            He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying. <br>
            Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the <br>
            corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings. <span class="tag lineNumber">30365</span><br>
            Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into <br>
            the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to <br>
            be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the <br>
            bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment <span class="tag lineNumber">30370</span><br>
            of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision <br>
            of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and <br>
            the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had <br>
            long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been <br>
            patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent, <span class="tag lineNumber">30375</span><br>
            sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin <br>
            and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of <br>
            His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His <br>
            commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after <br>
            sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight <span class="tag lineNumber">30380</span><br>
            of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He <br>
            was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then <br>
            come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against <br>
            the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt <br>
            nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity. <span class="tag lineNumber">30385</span><br>
            What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great <br>
            general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned? <br>
            All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would <br>
            reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was <br>
            enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the <span class="tag lineNumber">30390</span><br>
            body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The <br>
            particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the <br>
            abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled <br>
            howling into hell.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated <span class="tag lineNumber">30395</span><br>
            before men: after the particular there still remained the general <br>
            judgment. The last day had come. The doomsday was at hand. <br>
            The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs <br>
            cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the <br>
            great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of <span class="tag lineNumber">30400</span><br>
            hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll <br>
            rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly <br>
            host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one <br>
            foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the <br>
            archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three <span class="tag lineNumber">30405</span><br>
            blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but <br>
            time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal <br>
            humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and <br>
            poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked. <br>
            The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls <span class="tag lineNumber">30410</span><br>
            of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of <br>
            Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the <br>
            supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God, <br>
            no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of <br>
            Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming <span class="tag lineNumber">30415</span><br>
            upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine <br>
            choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers <br>
            and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim, <br>
            God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is <br>
            heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom- <span class="tag lineNumber">30420</span><br>
            less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and <br>
            can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side bidding them <br>
            enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them. <br>
            The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty: <br>
            <span class="emph">Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</span> <span class="tag lineNumber">30425</span><br>
            <span class="emph">prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> O what agony then for <br>
            the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn <br>
            from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner <br>
            holds out his arms to those who were dear and near to him in <br>
            this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he <span class="tag lineNumber">30430</span><br>
            made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead <br>
            him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to <br>
            the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too <br>
            late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which <br>
            now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil <span class="tag lineNumber">30435</span><br>
            character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you <br>
            who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul <br>
            within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that <br>
            terrible day?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of <span class="tag lineNumber">30440</span><br>
            death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die <br>
            and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and <br>
            manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some <br>
            unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when <br>
            you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing <span class="tag lineNumber">30445</span><br>
            that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all. <br>
            Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our <br>
            first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist- <br>
            ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen, <br>
            portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided <span class="tag lineNumber">30450</span><br>
            save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents or <br>
            master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever <br>
            before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of <br>
            terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has <br>
            walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in <span class="tag lineNumber">30455</span><br>
            life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching <br>
            the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer- <br>
            ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just <br>
            man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great <br>
            English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked <span class="tag lineNumber">30460</span><br>
            young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet <br>
            his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian, <br>
            who can say in his heart:<br> </p>
            <p class="lg">
              O grave, where is thy victory? <br>
              O death, where is thy sting? <span class="tag lineNumber">30465</span><br>
            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and <br>
            secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's <br>
            knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt <br>
            now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was <br>
            right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had <span class="tag lineNumber">30470</span><br>
            lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet <br>
            had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light. <br>
            The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant <br>
            his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through <br>
            his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled <span class="tag lineNumber">30475</span><br>
            before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and <br>
            huddled under a mane of hair.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light <br>
            laughter of a girl reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound <br>
            smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not <span class="tag lineNumber">30480</span><br>
            daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, <br>
            into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his <br>
            smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma <br>
            appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame <br>
            rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind <span class="tag lineNumber">30485</span><br>
            had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and <br>
            trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that <br>
            chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank <br>
            under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which <br>
            he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of <span class="tag lineNumber">30490</span><br>
            whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin- <br>
            ning in thought and deed: his monstrous dreams, peopled by <br>
            apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes: the <br>
            foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession <br>
            and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them <span class="tag lineNumber">30495</span><br>
            under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or <br>
            beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges <br>
            where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read <br>
            them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these <br>
            things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul <span class="tag lineNumber">30500</span><br>
            memories condensed within his brain.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to <br>
            raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the <br>
            Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and <br>
            stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined <span class="tag lineNumber">30505</span><br>
            that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in <br>
            tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud <br>

            deeply God's majesty, though it was the error of two children, <br>
            but it had not offended her whose beauty <span class="emph">is not like earthly</span> <br>
            <span class="emph">beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</span> <br>
            <span class="emph">which is its emblem, bright and musical</span>. The eyes were not <br>
            offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She <span class="tag lineNumber">30515</span><br>
            placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking <br>
            to their hearts: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Virgin Mary</span>―Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening <br>

            by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws. <br>

            of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped <span class="tag lineNumber">30630</span><br>
            together in their awful prison the walls of which are said to be <br>
            four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly <br>
            bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes <br>

            command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity <br>
            of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending <span class="tag lineNumber">30640</span><br>
            storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning <br>
            brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another <br>

            darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give <span class="tag lineNumber">30645</span><br>
            to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone <br>
            but for all eternity?<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its <br>

            sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged <br>
            the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro- <br>
            digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench: and the <br>
            bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential <br>
            odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would <span class="tag lineNumber">30655</span><br>
            suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, <br>
            that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has <br>
            been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of <br>
            the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has <br>
            lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of <span class="tag lineNumber">30660</span><br>
            liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames, <br>
            devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense <br>
            choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And <br>
            then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and <br>
            a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid <span class="tag lineNumber">30665</span><br>
            carcases massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and <br>
            rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some <br>
            idea of the horror of the stench of hell.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest <br>
            physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The <span class="tag lineNumber">30670</span><br>
            torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has <br>
            ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo- <br>

            But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man, <br>
            to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the <span class="tag lineNumber">30675</span><br>
            useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was <br>
            created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner. <br>
            Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according <br>
            as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so <br>
            that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical <span class="tag lineNumber">30680</span><br>
            preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu- <br>
            reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is <br>
            specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak- <br>
            able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time <br>
            as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur- <span class="tag lineNumber">30685</span><br>
            ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that <br>
            which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it <br>
            rages for ever.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it <br>
            may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell <span class="tag lineNumber">30690</span><br>
            is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the <br>
            devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was <br>
            obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into <br>
            the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant <br>
            like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the <span class="tag lineNumber">30695</span><br>
            bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will <br>
            be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals. <br>
            O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood <br>
            seethes and boils in the veins, the brains are boiling in the skull, <br>
            the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, the bowels a <span class="tag lineNumber">30700</span><br>
            redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like mol- <br>
            ten balls.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and <br>
            boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its <br>
            intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument <span class="tag lineNumber">30705</span><br>
            chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body <br>
            alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God, <br>
            working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine <br>
            vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the <br>
            body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the <span class="tag lineNumber">30710</span><br>
            flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of <br>
            the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness, <br>
            the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls <br>
            and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, <br>
            nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and <span class="tag lineNumber">30715</span><br>
            spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several <br>
            torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in <br>
            its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires <br>
            kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent <br>
            God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing fury by the <span class="tag lineNumber">30720</span><br>
            breath of the anger of the Godhead.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is <br>
            increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com- <br>
            pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by <br>
            instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly <span class="tag lineNumber">30725</span><br>
            or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no <br>
            thought of family or country, of ties or relationship. The <br>
            damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage <br>
            intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like <br>
            themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the <span class="tag lineNumber">30730</span><br>
            suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The <br>
            mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and <br>
            of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those <br>
            souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was <br>
            the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his <span class="tag lineNumber">30735</span><br>
            murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the <br>
            depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a <br>
            monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who <br>
            framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to <br>
            punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful <span class="tag lineNumber">30740</span><br>
            beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared <br>
            with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips <br>
            and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in <br>
            their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them <br>
            in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking <span class="tag lineNumber">30745</span><br>
            and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges- <br>
            tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured <br>
            them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom- <br>
            plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless <br>
            and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.<span class="tag lineNumber">30750</span><br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned <br>
            souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the devils. <br>
            These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by their pres- <br>
            ence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea of how <br>
            horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a <span class="tag lineNumber">30755</span><br>
            devil and she has written that, rather than look again for one <br>
            single instant on such a frightful monster, she would prefer to <br>
            walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These <br>
            devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous <br>
            and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at <span class="tag lineNumber">30760</span><br>
            the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the <br>
            foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience. <br>
            Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of <br>
            fiends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and <br>
            good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why <span class="tag lineNumber">30765</span><br>
            did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give <br>
            up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen <br>
            to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after <br>
            you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth <br>
            or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to <span class="tag lineNumber">30770</span><br>
            God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of <br>
            your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is, <br>
            time was but time shall be no more! Time was to sin in secrecy, <br>
            to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to <br>
            yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the <span class="tag lineNumber">30775</span><br>
            beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for <br>
            they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them: <br>
            time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so <br>
            many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out <br>
            that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those <span class="tag lineNumber">30780</span><br>
            illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy <br>
            church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not <br>
            abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those <br>
            dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish <br>
            tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and <span class="tag lineNumber">30785</span><br>
            of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when <br>
            they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with <br>
            such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, <br>
            even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis- <br>
            gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by <span class="tag lineNumber">30790</span><br>
            which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the <br>

            died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his <br>

            could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had <br>
            time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes? <br>
            What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of <span class="tag lineNumber">30815</span><br>
            the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the <br>
            swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave <br>
            of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His <br>
            brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and <br>

            burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices: <br>

            around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in <br>
            brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el- <span class="tag lineNumber">30850</span><br>

            and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard <br>

            not there among his school companions. Far away from there <br>

             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, <br>
            to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual <br>
            exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to <br>
            imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the <span class="tag lineNumber">30895</span><br>
            material character of that awful place and of the physical tor- <br>
            ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall <br>
            consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments <br>
            of hell.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to <span class="tag lineNumber">30900</span><br>
            the promptings of our corrupt nature, to the lower instincts, to <br>
            that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away <br>
            from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and <br>
            holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is <br>
            punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical <span class="tag lineNumber">30905</span><br>
            and spiritual.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain <br>
            of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater <br>
            than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the <br>
            church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst <span class="tag lineNumber">30910</span><br>
            damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is <br>
            totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately <br>
            turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a <br>
            being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being <br>
            must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very <span class="tag lineNumber">30915</span><br>
            clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell, <br>
            for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that <br>
            which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it <br>
            through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very <br>
            instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and <span class="tag lineNumber">30920</span><br>
            the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards <br>
            God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my <br>
            dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from <br>
            God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien- <br>
            ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and <span class="tag lineNumber">30925</span><br>
            every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise? <br>
            Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every <br>
            instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. And <br>
            if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man <br>
            to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered <span class="tag lineNumber">30930</span><br>
            from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for <br>
            the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely <br>
            good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into exist- <br>
            ence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with <br>
            an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from <span class="tag lineNumber">30935</span><br>
            its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that <br>
            separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable, this is the <br>
            greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing, <br>
            poena damni, the pain of loss.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in <span class="tag lineNumber">30940</span><br>
            hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are <br>
            engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there <br>
            arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the <br>
            sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls <br>
            it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm <span class="tag lineNumber">30945</span><br>
            will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem- <br>
            ory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the proud <br>
            king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but wicked <br>
            man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover of ar- <br>
            tistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures, <span class="tag lineNumber">30950</span><br>
            he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous <br>
            feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; <br>
            the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his <br>
            illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur- <br>
            derers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled, <span class="tag lineNumber">30955</span><br>
            the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures <br>
            in which they delighted. They will remember all this and loathe <br>
            themselves and their sins. For how miserable will all those <br>
            pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for <br>
            ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they <span class="tag lineNumber">30960</span><br>
            have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a few <br>
            pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a <br>
            tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the <br>
            second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless <br>
            sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under- <span class="tag lineNumber">30965</span><br>
            standing of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on <br>
            the sins of which they were guilty and, moreover, as saint <br>
            Augustine points out, God will impart to them His own <br>
            knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its <br>
            hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They <span class="tag lineNumber">30970</span><br>
            will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will <br>
            be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which <br>
            they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting <br>
            of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had <br>
            time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were <span class="tag lineNumber">30975</span><br>
            brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments <br>
            and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had <br>
            the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when <br>
            you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, <br>
            how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. <span class="tag lineNumber">30980</span><br>
            You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you <br>
            turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper <br>
            and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened <br>
            you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what <br>
            misery! The ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature <span class="tag lineNumber">30985</span><br>
            of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law. <br>
            No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all <br>
            hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of <br>
            repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true <br>
            repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for <span class="tag lineNumber">30990</span><br>
            you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to <br>
            repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which <br>
            gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled <br>

            curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them <br>
            and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the <br>

             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is <br>
            the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be <br>
            capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas- <br>
            much as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one <br>
            poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one <span class="tag lineNumber">31005</span><br>
            torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater <br>
            force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect <br>
            than the external senses so are they more capable of suffering. <br>
            Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every <br>
            spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive <span class="tag lineNumber">31010</span><br>
            faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and under- <br>
            standing with an interior darkness more terrible even than the <br>
            exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The <br>
            malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these demon <br>
            souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a <span class="tag lineNumber">31015</span><br>
            frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise <br>
            unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God <br>
            bears to it.<br> </p>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it <br>
            we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of all evils and, <span class="tag lineNumber">31020</span><br>
            as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at <br>
            their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of <br>
            any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay, <br>
            things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Com- <br>
            pany, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be <span class="tag lineNumber">31025</span><br>
            there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for as <br>
            the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse than <br>
            ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from the lord <br>
            of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be <br>
            loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very <span class="tag lineNumber">31030</span><br>
            long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by <br>
            habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight. <br>
            But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit for while <br>
            they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con- <br>
            tinual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another <span class="tag lineNumber">31035</span><br>
            and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer <br>
            flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense and various <br>
            tortures by succumbing to them for the soul in hell is sustained <br>

            Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity of suffer- <span class="tag lineNumber">31040</span><br>
            ing, unceasing variety of torture – this is what the divine <br>
            majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what the <br>
            holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low <br>
            pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the blood <br>
            of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption of <span class="tag lineNumber">31045</span><br>

             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Father Arnall</span>―Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful <br>
            place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O dread and dire word. <br>
            Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remem- <br>
            ber, it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell were <span class="tag lineNumber">31050</span><br>
            not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as <br>
            they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting <br>
            they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense, <br>
            unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for  all <br>
            eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must it be then to <span class="tag lineNumber">31055</span><br>
            bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever. For ever! For all <br>
            eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. Try to <br>
            imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the <br>
            sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how <br>
            many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful <span class="tag lineNumber">31060</span><br>
            which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of <br>
            that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the <br>
            farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re- <br>
            motest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine <br>
            such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multi- <span class="tag lineNumber">31065</span><br>
            plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in <br>
            the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on <br>
            animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that <br>
            at the end of every million years a little bird came to that <br>
            mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand. <span class="tag lineNumber">31070</span><br>
            How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass be- <br>
            fore that bird had carried away even a square foot of that <br>
            mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had <br>
            carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time <br>
            not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended. At <span class="tag lineNumber">31075</span><br>
            the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would <br>
            have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after it <br>
            had been all carried away and if the bird came again and <br>
            carried it all away again grain by grain: and if it so rose and <br>
            sank as many times as there are stars in the sky, atoms in the <span class="tag lineNumber">31080</span><br>
            air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on the trees, feathers upon <br>
            birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the end of all <br>
            those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably <br>
            vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to <br>
            have ended: even then, at the end of such a period, after that <span class="tag lineNumber">31085</span><br>
            eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain <br>
            reel dizzily, eternity would have scarcely begun.<br> </p>

            one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of agony <br>
            limitless in extent, limitless in intensity, of torment infinitely <br>
            lasting, infinitely varied, of torture that sustains eternally that <span class="tag lineNumber">31110</span><br>
            which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys <br>
            upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant <br>
            of which is itself an eternity, and that eternity an eternity of <br>
            woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for those who die <br>

            reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He  went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone <br>
            with his soul: and at every step his soul seemed  to sigh: at every <br>
            step his soul mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent, <br>
            through a region of viscid gloom.<span class="tag lineNumber">31205</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He halted on the landing before the door  and then, grasping <br>
            the porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, <br>
            his soul pining within him, praying silently that death might <br>
            not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that the <br>
            fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over <span class="tag lineNumber">31210</span><br>
            him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some <br>
            dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">murmuring faces</span>―We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound <br>
            to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in <br>
            endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to <span class="tag lineNumber">31215</span><br>
            ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of <br>
            course perfectly well—<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices <br>
            filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit <br>
            and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the <span class="tag lineNumber">31220</span><br>
            room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same win- <br>
            dow. He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely <br>
            no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark. <br>
            He told himself that it was simply his room with the door <br>
            open.<span class="tag lineNumber">31225</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt <br>
            beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were <br>
            cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest <br>
            and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why <br>
            was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? <span class="tag lineNumber">31230</span><br>
            To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet <br>
            his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and <br>
            circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He <br>
            could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of <br>
            soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, <span class="tag lineNumber">31235</span><br>
            flesh, benumbed and weary.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and <br>
            overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow- <br>
            ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to <br>
            forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, <span class="tag lineNumber">31240</span><br>
            wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again <br>
            with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against <br>
            heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called <br>
            God's child.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? <span class="tag lineNumber">31245</span><br>
            His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se- <br>
            cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni- <br>
            tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the <br>
            tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of <br>
            corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead? <span class="tag lineNumber">31250</span><br>
            The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing <br>
            upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget <br>
            them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and <br>
            binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the soul would not <br>
            be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places <span class="tag lineNumber">31255</span><br>
            where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, <br>
            he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He <br>
            desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and <br>
            until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant <br>
            and then opened. He saw.<span class="tag lineNumber">31260</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches. <br>
            Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis- <br>
            ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight <br>
            struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling <br>
            greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, <span class="tag lineNumber">31265</span><br>
            curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the <br>
            stale crusted dung.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were <br>
            moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with <br>
            human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india- <span class="tag lineNumber">31270</span><br>
            rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they <br>
            moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them. <br>
            A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. <br>
            One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an- <br>
            other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the <span class="tag lineNumber">31275</span><br>
            tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as <br>
            they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding <br>
            hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails <br>
            amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling <br>
            closer and closer, to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing <span class="tag lineNumber">31280</span><br>
            from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale <br>
            shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces .....<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Help!<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and <br>
            neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell <span class="tag lineNumber">31285</span><br>
            reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech- <br>
            erous goatish fiends. For him! For him!<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down <br>
            his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of <br>
            heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al- <span class="tag lineNumber">31290</span><br>
            most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion <br>
            seized him within: and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he <br>
            vomited profusely in agony.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win- <br>
            dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and <span class="tag lineNumber">31295</span><br>
            leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and <br>
            amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city <br>
            was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. <br>
            Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to <br>
            breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace <span class="tag lineNumber">31300</span><br>
            and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances he made a covenant <br>
            with his heart.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He prayed: <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―<span class="emph">He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but <br>
            we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a <span class="tag lineNumber">31305</span><br>
            shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God. <br>
            So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent <br>
            thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and <br>
            lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear <br>
            mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty, <span class="tag lineNumber">31310</span><br>
            dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy <br>
            emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven <br>
            and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim! <br>
            Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak <br>
            wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</span><span class="tag lineNumber">31315</span><br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph">His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to <br>
            heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch <br>
            of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed <br>
            behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer <span class="tag lineNumber">31320</span><br>
            and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con- <br>
            science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the <br>
            minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly <br>
            and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the <br>
            housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in, <span class="tag lineNumber">31325</span><br>
            before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he <br>
            would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly <br>
            through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the <br>
            footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so <span class="tag lineNumber">31330</span><br>
            many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in <br>
            mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an <br>
            instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing. <br>
            The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then <br>
            in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under- <span class="tag lineNumber">31335</span><br>
            stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field. <br>
            It must understand when it desires in one instant and then <br>
            prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels <br>
            and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made <br>
            it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand <span class="tag lineNumber">31340</span><br>
            bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman <br>
            thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at <br>
            the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender <br>
            marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why <br>
            was that so? O why?<span class="tag lineNumber">31345</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in <br>
            the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad- <br>
            ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in <br>
            darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to <br>
            drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to <span class="tag lineNumber">31350</span><br>
            his brain.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own <br>
            soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through <br>
            his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could <br>
            he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. <span class="tag lineNumber">31355</span><br>
            Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how <br>
            could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a <br>
            loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and <br>
            sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand <span class="tag lineNumber">31360</span><br>
            still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from <br>
            what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he <br>
            still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the <br>
            state of grace when God looked upon it with love!<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. <span class="tag lineNumber">31365</span><br>
            Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not <br>
            beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls <br>
            were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace <br>
            they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul <span class="tag lineNumber">31370</span><br>
            to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were <br>
            dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on <br>
            to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's <br>
            favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and <br>
            now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls <span class="tag lineNumber">31375</span><br>
            passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. <br>
            One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went <br>
            out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over <br>
            a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene <span class="tag lineNumber">31380</span><br>
            composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning <br>
            gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust, <br>
            moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross <br>
            the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her <br>
            was there a chapel near. <span class="tag lineNumber">31385</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">an old woman</span>―A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Church?<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and, <br>
            as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe <br>
            of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by <span class="tag lineNumber">31390</span><br>
            her voice. <br>
             <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Thank you.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">an old woman</span>―You are quite  welcome, sir.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the <br>
            fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded <span class="tag lineNumber">31395</span><br>
            workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through <br>
            a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and <br>
            words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of <br>
            the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. <br>
            He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body, <span class="tag lineNumber">31400</span><br>
            thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the <br>
            church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn <br>
            and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. <br>
            Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop <br>
            of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first <span class="tag lineNumber">31405</span><br>
            spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all <br>
            men to be meek and humble of heart.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be <br>
            meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside <br>
            him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside <span class="tag lineNumber">31410</span><br>
            them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared <br>
            not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, <br>
            in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the <br>
            carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a <br>
            lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending <span class="tag lineNumber">31415</span><br>
            their nets with patience.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred: <br>
            and, at the last moment glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey <br>
            beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered <br>
            the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the <span class="tag lineNumber">31420</span><br>
            confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back <br>
            and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a <br>
            sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little <br>
            flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the <span class="tag lineNumber">31425</span><br>
            houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by <br>
            the heated air.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side <br>
            of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered <br>
            quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint <span class="tag lineNumber">31430</span><br>
            murmur began again.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one <br>
            foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run <br>
            swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the <br>
            shame. O what shame! His face was burning with shame. Had <span class="tag lineNumber">31435</span><br>
            it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! <br>
            Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful <br>
            thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him <br>
            wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in <br>
            words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.<span class="tag lineNumber">31440</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far- <br>

            entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper- <br>

            the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour, <span class="tag lineNumber">31445</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover <br>

            Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with <span class="tag lineNumber">31450</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It <br>
            was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a <br>
            child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come <span class="tag lineNumber">31455</span><br>
            to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was <br>
            merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised <br>

            would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then <span class="tag lineNumber">31465</span><br>
            what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But <br>
            God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was <br>

            offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions <br>
            tions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The raw <br>
            morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he knelt <span class="tag lineNumber">40010</span><br>
            among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following with his <br>
            interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he glanced up <br>
            for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom <br>
            between the two candles which were the old and the new <br>
            testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the <span class="tag lineNumber">40015</span><br>
            catacombs.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of <br>
            ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the <br>
            souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; <br>
            yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so <span class="tag lineNumber">40020</span><br>
            many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly re- <br>
            ward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much <br>
            temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for <br>
            the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst of the purga- <br>
            torial fire, which differed from the infernal only in that it was <span class="tag lineNumber">40025</span><br>
            not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a drop of <br>
            moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of <br>
            works of supererogation.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as <br>
            the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of <span class="tag lineNumber">40030</span><br>
            spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; <br>
            every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness <br>
            could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his <br>
            sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he <br>
            seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the <span class="tag lineNumber">40035</span><br>
            keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his <br>
            purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but <br>
            as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried his <br>
            beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as <span class="tag lineNumber">40040</span><br>
            he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals of <br>
            flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to <br>
            him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. He offered <br>
            up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow <br>
            strong in each of the three theological virtues, in faith in the <span class="tag lineNumber">40045</span><br>
            Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had <br>
            redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanc- <br>
            tified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three <br>
            Persons through Mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful <br>
            and glorious  mysteries.<span class="tag lineNumber">40050</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that <br>
            one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon <br>
            his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins <br>
            which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each gift on <br>
            its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon him, <span class="tag lineNumber">40055</span><br>
            though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and <br>
            understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature <br>
            that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he <br>
            believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this <br>
            difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been <span class="tag lineNumber">40060</span><br>
            raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person <br>
            son of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more, <br>
            and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom and silence <br>
            wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols were a <br>
            dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was a sin be- <span class="tag lineNumber">40065</span><br>
            yond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being to <br>
            Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed <br>
            in the scarlet of the tongues of fire.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the <br>
            Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the <span class="tag lineNumber">40070</span><br>
            books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating <br>
            from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and <br>
            thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit <br>
            proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were easier <br>
            of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incompre- <span class="tag lineNumber">40075</span><br>
            hensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul <br>
            from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the <br>
            world, for ages before the world itself had existed. He had <br>
            heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced <br>
            solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set <span class="tag lineNumber">40080</span><br>
            forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his soul was <br>
            unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter <br>
            their names with conviction. A brief anger had often invested <br>
            him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion <br>
            and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body <span class="tag lineNumber">40085</span><br>
            were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel. He <br>
            had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence penetrate his <br>
            being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it too had <br>
            slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent. <br>
            This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his <span class="tag lineNumber">40090</span><br>
            soul would harbour.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since <br>
            God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love <br>
            from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with <br>
            spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast <span class="tag lineNumber">40095</span><br>
            symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became a <br>
            divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it <br>
            even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his <br>
            soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its <br>
            solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul <span class="tag lineNumber">40100</span><br>
            save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. So <br>
            entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning <br>
            in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand <br>
            stand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue <br>
            to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and he <span class="tag lineNumber">40105</span><br>
            dared not question its use, he above all others who had sinned <br>
            so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. Meek and <br>
            abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent <br>
            perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties, <br>
            masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and <span class="tag lineNumber">40110</span><br>
            only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great <br>
            mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like <br>
            that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself. The <br>
            attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised and parted hands, <br>
            the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon, became for <span class="tag lineNumber">40115</span><br>
            him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated and faint before <br>
            her Creator.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exal- <br>
            tation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or <br>
            lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification to <span class="tag lineNumber">40120</span><br>
            undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught <br>
            with peril. Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous <br>
            discipline. In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his <br>
            rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes, glancing neither <br>
            to right nor left and never behind him. His eyes shunned every <span class="tag lineNumber">40125</span><br>
            encounter with the eyes of women. From time to time also he <br>
            balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting them <br>
            suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing <br>
            the book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his <br>
            voice which was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled and <span class="tag lineNumber">40130</span><br>
            made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful <br>
            nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the <br>
            knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the <br>
            twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult <br>
            as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours, <span class="tag lineNumber">40135</span><br>
            whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as <br>
            those of dung and tar or the odours of his own person among <br>
            which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments. <br>
            ments. He found in the end that the only odour against which <br>
            his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like <span class="tag lineNumber">40140</span><br>
            that of longstanding urine: and whenever it was possible he <br>
            subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste <br>
            he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all the <br>
            fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind <br>
            from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification <span class="tag lineNumber">40145</span><br>
            cation of touch that he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of <br>
            inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in <br>
            bed, sat in the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently <br>
            every itch and pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his <br>
            knees all through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of <span class="tag lineNumber">40150</span><br>
            his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and, <br>
            whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly <br>
            at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped <br>
            behind him.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him <span class="tag lineNumber">40155</span><br>
            however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety <br>
            and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and <br>
            unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him little <br>
            for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at <br>
            being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense effort of <span class="tag lineNumber">40160</span><br>
            his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to <br>
            such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which <br>
            he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths, <br>
            closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, dis- <br>
            couraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison. <span class="tag lineNumber">40165</span><br>
            son. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was <br>
            harder for him than any fasting or prayer, and it was his <br>
            constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused <br>
            in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with <br>
            a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed a period of <span class="tag lineNumber">40170</span><br>
            desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have <br>
            turned into dried up sources. His confession became a channel <br>
            for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His <br>
            actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same <br>
            dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual <span class="tag lineNumber">40175</span><br>
            tual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some <br>
            visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for <br>
            these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus <br>
            sus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves. <br>
            A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to <span class="tag lineNumber">40180</span><br>
            be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the <br>
            imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's <br>
            cant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul, <br>
            telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal <br>
            and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana <span class="tag lineNumber">40185</span><br>
            and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to <br>
            answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Inter ubera mea commorabitur.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind <br>
            now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices <span class="tag lineNumber">40190</span><br>
            of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his <br>
            prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of power <br>
            to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a moment <br>
            of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to feel a <br>
            flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting <span class="tag lineNumber">40195</span><br>
            ing for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his <br>
            fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost <br>
            at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far <br>
            away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of <br>
            the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line of <span class="tag lineNumber">40200</span><br>
            the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance to- <br>
            wards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his <br>
            soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in <br>
            this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace <span class="tag lineNumber">40205</span><br>
            which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him <br>
            little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew <br>
            dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really <br>
            fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old <br>
            consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had <span class="tag lineNumber">40210</span><br>
            prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace which he <br>
            had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as God <br>
            was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of <br>
            temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard <br>
            about the trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations <span class="tag lineNumber">40215</span><br>
            were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that <br>
            the devil raged to make it fall.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some <br>
            momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger <br>
            in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden <span class="tag lineNumber">40220</span><br>
            by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution <br>
            ution was given him. He named it with humility and shame and <br>
            repented of it once more. It humiliated and shamed him to <br>
            think that he would never be freed from it wholly, however <br>
            holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might <span class="tag lineNumber">40225</span><br>
            attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present with <br>
            him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and <br>
            repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that <br>
            first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had <br>
            not been good? Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent <span class="tag lineNumber">40230</span><br>
            doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin? But the surest <br>
            sign that his confession had been good and that he had had <br>
            sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the amendment of his <br>
            life. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I have amended  my life, have I not? he asked himself.<span class="tag lineNumber">40235</span><br></p> </p>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back <br>
            to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and, as <br>
            he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of <br>
            the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following for a mo- <br>
            ment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight <span class="tag lineNumber">40240</span><br>
            above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly <br>
            fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the waning <br>
            daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples <br>
            and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with his ears <br>
            the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke <span class="tag lineNumber">40245</span><br>
            gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which <br>
            had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference <br>
            ence of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily <br>
            with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on <br>
            again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a <span class="tag lineNumber">40250</span><br>
            prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the <br>
            message of summons had come for him from the director his <br>
            mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message; and <br>
            during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour <br>
            waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from <span class="tag lineNumber">40255</span><br>
            one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind had <br>
            wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the <br>
            summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing <br>
            ing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from <br>
            coming he had heard the handle of the door turning and the <span class="tag lineNumber">40260</span><br>
            swish of a soutane.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The director had begun to speak of the dominican and fran- <br>
            ciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas and <br>
            saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was rather <br>
            too .......<span class="tag lineNumber">40265</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not <br>
            being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative <br>
            movement with his lips. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the director</span>―I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now <br>
            among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and <span class="tag lineNumber">40270</span><br>
            following the example of the other franciscans.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen.<br> </p>

            but for the street I really think it would be better to do away <br>
            with it, don't you?<span class="tag lineNumber">40275</span><br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―It must be troublesome, I imagine.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Bel- <br>
            gium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could <span class="tag lineNumber">40285</span><br>
            not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only <br>
            passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell <br>
            upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky, <br>
            glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow <br>
            which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek.<span class="tag lineNumber">40290</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain <br>
            soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to <br>
            his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined <br>
            ined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken <br>
            bands and it shocked him to feel at <span class="hide">53.293003 -6.168866</span>Stradbrook the greasy <span class="tag lineNumber">40295</span><br>
            leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt for <br>
            the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of <br>
            a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he read save <br>
            that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own <br>
            state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft <span class="tag lineNumber">40300</span><br>
            stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman <br>
            moving with tender life.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he <br>
            knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The <br>
            phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his <span class="tag lineNumber">40305</span><br>
            face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever <br>
            he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside <br>
            frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, <br>
            even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him <br>
            always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited <span class="tag lineNumber">40310</span><br>
            prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies <br>
            briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all <br>
            the years he had lived among them in <span class="hide">53.310601 -6.695541</span>Clongowes <br>
            and in <span class="hide">52.207800 -8.211070</span>Bel-
            vedere he had received only two pandies and, though these had <br>
            been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped <span class="tag lineNumber">40315</span><br>
            punishment. During all those years he had never heard from <br>
            any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught <br>
            him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and, <br>
            when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who had led <br>
            him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of <span class="tag lineNumber">40320</span><br>
            himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him <br>
            diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal <br>
            position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained <br>
            with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never <br>
            once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him <span class="tag lineNumber">40325</span><br>
            from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when he doubted <br>
            some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt <br>
            openly. Lately some of their judgments had sounded a little <br>
            childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as <br>
            though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and <span class="tag lineNumber">40330</span><br>
            were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some <br>
            boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the <br>
            chapel he had heard the priest say:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never <br>
            committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate <span class="tag lineNumber">40335</span><br>
            mortal sin.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo <br>
            were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered <br>
            that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had <br>
            turned against the church as he had written when he was a <span class="tag lineNumber">40340</span><br>
            catholic. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, <br>
            who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, <br>
            had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon <span class="tag lineNumber">40345</span><br>
            Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still <br>
            fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew <br>
            hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed <br>
            quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he <br>
            was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance <span class="tag lineNumber">40350</span><br>

            watching the sports in <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes and eating slim jim out of his <br>
            cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in <br>
            the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used <br>
            in <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes sounded in remote caves of his mind.<span class="tag lineNumber">40355</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the si- <br>
            lence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was <br>
            addressing him in a different voice.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to <br>
            you on a very important subject.<span class="tag lineNumber">40360</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―Yes, sir.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―Have you ever felt that you had a vocation?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the <br>
            word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added:<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a <span class="tag lineNumber">40365</span><br>
            desire to join the order. Think.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his <br>
            hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with <br>
            himself. <span class="tag lineNumber">40370</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>―In a college like this,</p> he said at length, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Priest</span>there is one boy or <br>
            perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. <br>
            Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety, by <br>
            the good example he shows to others. He is looked up to by <br>
            them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists. <span class="tag lineNumber">40375</span><br>
            And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this college, prefect <br>
            of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you are the boy in this <br>
            college whom God designs to call to Himself.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's <br>
            voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response.<span class="tag lineNumber">40380</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest <br>
            honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No <br>
            king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest <br>
            of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even <br>
            the Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the <span class="tag lineNumber">40385</span><br>
            power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the <br>
            power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of <br>
            God the evil spirits that have power over them, the power, the <br>
            authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon <br>
            the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful <span class="tag lineNumber">40390</span><br>
            power, Stephen!<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he <br>
            heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings. <br>
            How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and <br>
            humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in <span class="tag lineNumber">40395</span><br>
            reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire. <br>
            He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, en- <br>
            tering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, in- <br>
            censing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the <br>
            priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of <span class="tag lineNumber">40400</span><br>
            reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he <br>
            had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and <br>
            gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent <br>
            his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the thurible <br>
            only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like <span class="tag lineNumber">40405</span><br>
            that of such another as he had turned to the altar again after <br>
            having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to <br>
            fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He <br>
            shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him <br>
            to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own <span class="tag lineNumber">40410</span><br>
            person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final <br>
            an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested <br>
            with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from <br>
            the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a <br>
            humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds, or, when the <span class="tag lineNumber">40415</span><br>
            sacrifice had  been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dal- <br>
            matic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his <br>
            hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the <br>
            chant Ite, missa est. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was <br>
            as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a <span class="tag lineNumber">40420</span><br>
            church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, <br>
            at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish <br>
            than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his <br>
            will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality: and it was <br>
            partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always con- <span class="tag lineNumber">40425</span><br>
            strained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to <br>
            cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he <br>
            longed to give.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and <br>
            through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bid- <span class="tag lineNumber">40430</span><br>
            ding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and secret <br>
            power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon Magus <br>
            and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which there was <br>
            no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden from <br>
            others, from those who  were conceived and born children of <span class="tag lineNumber">40435</span><br>
            wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful <br>
            thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured <br>
            into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened <br>
            chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but rendered immune <br>
            mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his <span class="tag lineNumber">40440</span><br>
            soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of <br>
            the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands with <br>
            which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin <br>
            would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink <br>
            damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. He <span class="tag lineNumber">40445</span><br>
            would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, being as <br>
            sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for ever <br>
            according to the order of Melchisedec.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, <br>
            tor, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And <span class="tag lineNumber">40450</span><br>

            martyr, who is very powerful with God, that God may en- <br>
            lighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, that <br>
            you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found <br>
            afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, <span class="tag lineNumber">40455</span><br>
            remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy <br>
            Orders is one of those which can be received only once because <br>
            it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can <br>
            never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It <br>
            is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the <span class="tag lineNumber">40460</span><br>
            salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God to- <br>
            gether.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if <br>
            already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out <br>
            on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of <span class="tag lineNumber">40465</span><br>
            the caress of mild evening air. Towards <span class="hide">53.354445 -6.263812</span>Findlater's church a <br>
            quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms, <br>
            swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their <br>
            leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first <br>
            bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of <span class="tag lineNumber">40470</span><br>
            his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden <br>
            wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling at the <br>
            trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, seeing in it <br>
            a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached his hand <br>
            slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship.<span class="tag lineNumber">40475</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his <br>
            troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting <br>
            a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The shadow, <br>
            then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness. <br>
            ness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life that <span class="tag lineNumber">40480</span><br>
            awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered how <br>
            he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what <br>
            dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. The <br>
            troubling odour of the long corridors of <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes came back <br>
            to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning <span class="tag lineNumber">40485</span><br>
            gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest began to <br>
            irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din <br>
            of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and <br>
            thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and sank as if he were <br>
            inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the <span class="tag lineNumber">40490</span><br>
            warm moist air which hung in the bath in <span class="hide">53.348746 -6.275034</span>Clongowes above the <br>
            sluggish turfcoloured water.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than edu- <br>
            cation or piety, quickened within him at every near approach <br>
            to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him <span class="tag lineNumber">40495</span><br>
            against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life repelled <br>
            him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing <br>
            down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to <br>
            struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his <br>
            stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community <span class="tag lineNumber">40500</span><br>
            of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted shyness of <br>
            his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange <br>
            roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had <br>
            always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His name in that new life leaped into characters before his <br>
            eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an unde- <br>
            fined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became <br>
            strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw <span class="tag lineNumber">40510</span><br>
            reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the <br>
            shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured <br>
            voured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger. <br>
            Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits <br>

            Gardiner Street, and wondered vaguely which window would <br>
            be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the <br>
            vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul <span class="tag lineNumber">40520</span><br>
            from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail <br>
            hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him <br>
            when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to <br>
            end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of <br>
            the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church <span class="tag lineNumber">40525</span><br>
            and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself <br>
            idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it <br>
            and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had <br>
            already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing <br>
            the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to <span class="tag lineNumber">40530</span><br>
            be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the <br>
            priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined <br>
            to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the <br>
            wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the <br>
            world.<span class="tag lineNumber">40535</span><br> </p>

            He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. <br>
            Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse <br>
            of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling, <br>
            falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall.<span class="tag lineNumber">40540</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <span class="hide"> 53.361845 -6.242480</span>Tolka and <br>
            turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue <br>
            shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in <br>
            the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages. <br>
            Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to <span class="tag lineNumber">40545</span><br>
            his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came to- <br>
            wards him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground above <br>
            the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the <br>
            misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation <br>
            of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a <span class="tag lineNumber">40550</span><br>
            short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary <br>
            farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they <br>
            had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second laugh, taking <br>
            rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily <br>
            as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering <span class="tag lineNumber">40555</span><br>
            in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging <br>
            his spade in the earth.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed <br>
            through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his <br>
            brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly <span class="tag lineNumber">40560</span><br>
            over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in <br>
            the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots which did ser- <br>
            vice for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread, <br>
            turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay <br>
            scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on <span class="tag lineNumber">40565</span><br>
            the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck <br>

            had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest: <br>
            but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and <br>

            singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, <br>
            glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon, <span class="tag lineNumber">40590</span><br>

            Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary <span class="tag lineNumber">40595</span><br>

            then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first, <span class="tag lineNumber">40610</span><br>
            planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork <br>
            of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. A full <br>
            hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, <br>
            the tutor, to find out for him something about the <span class="hide">53.310485 -6.225058</span>university. <br>
            For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he <span class="tag lineNumber">40615</span><br>

            watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and <br>
            strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force <span class="tag lineNumber">40625</span><br>
            within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her dis- <br>
            loyalty: and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind serene <br>
            and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of the <span class="tag lineNumber">40630</span><br>

            sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to <br>
            them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him <br>
            like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet <br>
            did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and now it <span class="tag lineNumber">40635</span><br>
            beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to <br>
            be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful <br>
            music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished <br>
            fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like <br>
            triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of <span class="tag lineNumber">40640</span><br>
            a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; <br>
            and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of <br>
            time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses <br>
            wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the <br>
            leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the <span class="tag lineNumber">40645</span><br>
            feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and ante- <br>
            lopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a <br>
            proud cadence from Newman: <span class="emph">Whose feet are as the feet of <br>
            harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the <span class="tag lineNumber">40650</span><br>
            dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood he <br>
            had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his <br>
            destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the <br>
            call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now <br>
            time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint his <span class="tag lineNumber">40655</span><br>
            body. He had refused. Why?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He turned seaward  from the road at <span class="hide">53.365979 -6.174239</span>Dollymount and as he <br>
            passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking <br>
            with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian <br>
            brothers was on its way back from the <span class="hide">53.369769 -6.147334</span>Bull and had begun to <span class="tag lineNumber">40660</span><br>
            pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was <br>
            trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him two <br>
            by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as he <br>
            strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint stain <br>
            of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face. <span class="tag lineNumber">40665</span><br>
            Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by <br>
            gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under <br>
            the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy <br>
            silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging cleri- <br>

            of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable <br>
            able than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly <br>

            apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of <br>
            clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and <span class="tag lineNumber">40695</span><br>
            balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise <br>
            and fall of words better than their associations of legend and <br>
            colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of <br>
            mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. <br>
            At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and <span class="tag lineNumber">40705</span><br>
            looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall dark- <br>
            ening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his heart, a <br>
            faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh <br>
            dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not <br>
            strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along <span class="tag lineNumber">40710</span><br>
            the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where <br>
            the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the <br>
            slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more <br>
            distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a <span class="tag lineNumber">40715</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting <span class="tag lineNumber">40720</span><br>
            clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the <br>
            deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging <br>
            high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come <br>
            from lay out there beyond the <span class="hide">53.13 -5.32</span>Irish Sea, Europe of strange <br>
            tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of <span class="tag lineNumber">40725</span><br>
            entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music <br>
            within him as of memories and names which he was almost <br>
            conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the <br>

            receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one long- <span class="tag lineNumber">40730</span><br>
            drawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence. <br>
            Again! Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world <br>

            the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that <br>

            and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wan- <br>
            dering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the <br>
            earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen <br>
            above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before <br>
            the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. <span class="tag lineNumber">40820</span><br>
            Where?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He looked northward towards <span class="hide">53.378569 -6.057013</span>Howth. The sea had fallen <br>
            below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater <br>
            water and already the tide was running out fast along the <br>
            foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and <span class="tag lineNumber">40825</span><br>
            dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand <br>
            gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and around <br>
            the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were <br>
            lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in <span class="tag lineNumber">40830</span><br>
            his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces <br>
            over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick out of <br>
            the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of <br>
            the breakwater.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> There was a long rivulet in the <span class="hide">53.366498 -6.147804</span>strand: and, as he waded <span class="tag lineNumber">40835</span><br>
            slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of sea- <br>
            weed. Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved <br>
            beneath the current, swaying and turning. The water of the <br>
            rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting <br>
            ing clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently and <span class="tag lineNumber">40840</span><br>
            silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey <br>
            warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had <br>
            hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of <br>
            her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to <span class="tag lineNumber">40845</span><br>
            queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the <br>
            touch? Or where was he?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild <br>
            heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wild- <br>
            hearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters <span class="tag lineNumber">40850</span><br>
            and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight <br>
            and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and voices <br>
            childish and girlish in the air.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing <br>
            out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into <span class="tag lineNumber">40855</span><br>
            the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender <br>
            bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an <br>
            emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the <br>
            flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared al- <br>
            most to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were <span class="tag lineNumber">40860</span><br>
            like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were <br>
            kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her <br>
            bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the <br>
            breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was <br>
            girlish; and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal <span class="tag lineNumber">40865</span><br>
            beauty, her face.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt <br>
            his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him <br>
            in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. <br>
            Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her <span class="tag lineNumber">40870</span><br>
            eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring <br>
            the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise <br>
            of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and <br>
            whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither <br>
            and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.<span class="tag lineNumber">40875</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> ―Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of pro- <br>

            were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out <span class="tag lineNumber">40880</span><br>
            over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the <br>
            advent of the life that had cried to him.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had <br>
            broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called him <br>

            triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared <br>
            to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from <br>
            the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of <br>
            ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on <br>
            and on and on!<span class="tag lineNumber">40890</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How <br>
            far had he walked? What hour was it?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne <br>
            to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already <br>

            the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the <br>
            sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sand- <br>
            knolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the <br>
            evening might still the riot of his blood.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm <span class="tag lineNumber">40900</span><br>
            processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, <br>
            the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids <br>
            trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth <br>

            some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, <br>
            fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy <br>
            shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering <br>
            ing and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light, <br>
            an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, <span class="tag lineNumber">40910</span><br>
            breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest <br>
            rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding all <br>
            the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than other.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid <br>
            grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, re- <span class="tag lineNumber">40915</span><br>
            calling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him. <br>
            Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the pale <br>
            waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey <br>
            sand: and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low <span class="tag lineNumber">40920</span><br>

            chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, <br>

            been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought <br>

            Clongowes. The box of pawntickets at his elbow had just been <br>
            rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers <br>
            the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased <br>

            His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an <br>

            echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but as he <br>
            walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling <br>
            about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange <br>
            wild smell of the wet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her <br>
            miseries.<span class="tag lineNumber">50070</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, <br>

            Hauptmann: and the memory of their pale sorrows and the <br>
            fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of <br>
            quiet joy. His morning walk across <span class="hide">53.363150 -6.270676</span>the city had begun: and he <span class="tag lineNumber">50075</span><br>
            foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would <br>
            think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he <br>
            walked along <span class="hide">53.357548 -6.242725</span>the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the win- <br>
            dows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour <br>
            of Guido Cavalcanti and smile, that as he went by Baird's <span class="tag lineNumber">50080</span><br>
            stonecutting works in <span class="hide">53.350416 -6.251694</span>Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would <br>
            blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish <br>
            beauty, and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond <br>
            the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which <br>
            begins:<span class="tag lineNumber">50085</span><br> </p>
            <p class="lg"> <span class="emph">I was not wearier where I lay.</span></p> <br>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of <br>
            beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned <br>
            often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. <br>
            His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in <span class="tag lineNumber">50090</span><br>
            shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and <br>
            mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist- <br>
            coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of <br>
            chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and <br>
            drove him on from his lurkingplace.<span class="tag lineNumber">50095</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding <br>
            upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of youth <br>

            and psychology and a Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad <br>
            mentem divi Thomae. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and <span class="tag lineNumber">50100</span><br>
            selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but <br>
            lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the <br>
            world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed: <br>
            and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of <br>
            others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of <span class="tag lineNumber">50105</span><br>
            beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at <br>
            least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief <br>
            pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find him- <br>
            self still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid <br>
            the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a <span class="tag lineNumber">50110</span><br>
            light heart.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive <br>

            brella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must be <br>
            eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The <br>
            clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, <br>
            as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him but <br>
            unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as <span class="tag lineNumber">50120</span><br>
            he heard it for it made him think of MacCann and he saw him <br>
            a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair <br>
            goatee standing in the wind at <span class="hide">53.351242 -6.260779</span>Hopkins' corner, and heard him <br>
            say: <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">MacCann</span>―Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. <span class="tag lineNumber">50125</span><br>

            and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of <br>
            the Europe of the future. <br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of <br>
            the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the <span class="tag lineNumber">50130</span><br>
            headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven; English: eleven <br>
            to twelve; French: twelve to one; physics. He fancied to himself <br>
            the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and <br>
            helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as <br>
            they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to <span class="tag lineNumber">50135</span><br>
            note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or <br>
            dates of birth and death, chief works, a favourable and an <br>
            unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent <br>
            for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked <br>
            around the little class of students or out of the window across <span class="tag lineNumber">50140</span><br>
            the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of <br>
            cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head than his, right <br>
            before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its <br>
            bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without <br>
            humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about <span class="tag lineNumber">50145</span><br>
            him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could <br>
            never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but <br>
            only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey <br>
            curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom <br>
            of a dream, the face of a severed head or deathmask, crowned <span class="tag lineNumber">50150</span><br>
            on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. <br>
            It was a priestlike face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide- <br>
            winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the <br>
            jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and <br>
            faintly smiling: and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had <span class="tag lineNumber">50155</span><br>
            told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his <br>
            soul, day after day and night by night only to be answered by <br>
            his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it <br>
            was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those <br>
            whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in <span class="tag lineNumber">50160</span><br>
            memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark <br>
            cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it feeling <br>
            that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of his <br>
            friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him <span class="tag lineNumber">50165</span><br>
            a tenuous and deadly exhalation: and he found himself <br>
            glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in <br>
            stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instan- <br>
            taneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind <br>
            like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with <span class="tag lineNumber">50170</span><br>
            age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. <br>
            His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain <br>
            and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band <br>
            and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:<br> </p>

            were handed on to him in the trite words in tanto discrimine <span class="tag lineNumber">50195</span><br>

            through the words implere ollam denariorum which the rector <br>
            had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. <br>
            The pages of his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the touch <br>

            fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother William <br>

            were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in <span class="tag lineNumber">50205</span><br>
            myrtle and lavender and vervain: but yet it wounded him to <br>
            think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the <br>
            world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of <br>
            which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was <br>
            held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and <span class="tag lineNumber">50210</span><br>

            was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he <br>
            thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a <br>

            lightly, saying: <br>

            speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill - (for <br>
            Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael), <br>
            repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or <br>
            by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes <span class="tag lineNumber">50240</span><br>
            the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew <br>

            beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided against themselves <br>

            the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal <br>

            there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. <br>
            Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on <br>

            miles from <span class="hide">52.399821 -8.575387</span>Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. <span class="tag lineNumber">50300</span><br>
            You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or <br>
            hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped <br>
            by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the <br>
            dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last <br>
            after a bend of the road I spied a little cottage with a light in <span class="tag lineNumber">50305</span><br>
            the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked <br>
            who was there and I answered I was over at the match in <br>
            Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a <br>
            glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door <br>
            and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed <span class="tag lineNumber">50310</span><br>
            as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair <br>
            hanging: and I thought by her figure and by something in the <br>
            look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me <br>
            in talk a long while at the door and I thought it strange because <br>
            her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I <span class="tag lineNumber">50315</span><br>
            tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was <br>
            all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that <br>
            morning to <span class="hide">53.273188 -6.092767</span>Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all <br>
            the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my <br>
            face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. <span class="tag lineNumber">50320</span><br>
            When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to <br>
            draw me in over the threshold and said: <span class="emph">Come in and stay the <br>

            but ourselves</span> ........ I didn't go in, Stevie.  I thanked her and <br>
            went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the <span class="tag lineNumber">50325</span><br>

            the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the <br>
            physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not un- <br>
            watchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it <br>
            because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was a <br>
            secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial <span class="tag lineNumber">50375</span><br>
            and was he walking among aliens? The Irelandof Tone and of <br>
            Parnell seemed to have receded in space.<br> </p>

            grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure <br>
            was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and <span class="tag lineNumber">50380</span><br>
            greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the <br>
            fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fire- <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Good morning, sir! Can I help you?<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The priest looked up quickly and said: <span class="tag lineNumber">50385</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> He produced four candle butts from the sidepockets of his <br>

            flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of <span class="tag lineNumber">50395</span><br>
            his wisps of paper and candle butts he seemed more than ever a <br>
            humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty <br>
            temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen <br>
            the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one <br>
            whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would irk and <span class="tag lineNumber">50400</span><br>
            trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the <br>
            Lord – in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings se- <br>
            cretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when <br>
            bidden – and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or <br>
            of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that <span class="tag lineNumber">50405</span><br>
            service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading <br>
            abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity – a mortified will no more <br>
            responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of <br>
            love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a <br>

            glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist <span class="tag lineNumber">50415</span><br>
            is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a <br>
            brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at <span class="tag lineNumber">50435</span><br>
            him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but <br>
            in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the <br>
            legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret <br>
            than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his <br>
            soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the <span class="tag lineNumber">50440</span><br>
            shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for <br>
            the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or <br>
            hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a <br>
            firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: and for all <br>
            this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master <span class="tag lineNumber">50445</span><br>
            and little, if at all, the ends he served. Similiter atque senis <br>
            baculus, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a <br>
            staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to be leaned <br>
            on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to lie with a <br>
            lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.<span class="tag lineNumber">50450</span><br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his <br>
            chin. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>―When may we expect to have something from you on the <br>
            esthetic question?</p> he asked.<br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>―These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus,</p> said the <br>

            Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and <span class="tag lineNumber">50460</span><br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure <br>
            that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>―Ha!<span class="tag lineNumber">50465</span><br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one <br>

            done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or <span class="tag lineNumber">50470</span><br>
            smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I <br>
            shall sell it and buy or borrow another.<br> </p>

            a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his <br>
            philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?<span class="tag lineNumber">50475</span><br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―An old gentleman,</p> said Stephen coarsely, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>who said that the <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>―He tells us in his homely way,</p> the dean went on, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>that he put <br>
            an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief <br>
            stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that <span class="tag lineNumber">50480</span><br>
            it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy <br>
            an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle <br>
            butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle <br>
            of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The <span class="tag lineNumber">50485</span><br>
            priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind <br>
            halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery <br>
            and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a <br>
            reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? <br>
            A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, <span class="tag lineNumber">50490</span><br>
            charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God? <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―I meant a different kind of lamp, sir,</p> said Stephen.<br> 
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">the dean</span>―Undoubtedly,</p> said the dean.<br> 
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―One difficulty,</p> said Stephen, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>in esthetic discussion is to <br>
            know whether words are being used according to the literary <span class="tag lineNumber">50495</span><br>

            remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the <br>
            Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the <br>

            history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and <br>
            envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through <br>
            – a latecomer, a tardy spirit.  From what had he set out? Per- <span class="tag lineNumber">50530</span><br>
            haps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, <br>
            seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of <br>
            the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith <br>
            amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent <br>
            schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake <span class="tag lineNumber">50535</span><br>
            baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true <br>
            church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of <br>
            cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation or the <br>
            imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or <br>
            had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that <span class="tag lineNumber">50540</span><br>
            disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the <br>
            door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and telling over his <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his <br>

            jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old <br>
            professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It <br>
            seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through <span class="tag lineNumber">50625</span><br>

            of the young professor of mental science discussing on the <br>

            held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He <span class="tag lineNumber">50665</span><br>
            explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound <br>

            his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, <br>
            began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin: <span class="tag lineNumber">50675</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Moynihan</span>―Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> A sharp <span class="hide">54.407332 -7.024250</span>Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen: <span class="tag lineNumber">50685</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure <br>
            science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing gold <br>
            spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moyni- <br>

            the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his <span class="tag lineNumber">50695</span><br>
            mind think that the student's father would have done better <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of <br>
            thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he <span class="tag lineNumber">50700</span><br>

            tween them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of <br>
            signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the stu- <br>
            dents, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after <span class="tag lineNumber">50720</span><br>
            another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood <br>
            talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nod- <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresol- <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cranly</span>―Are you annoyed? he asked.<br> </p>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Moynihan</span>―MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. <br>
            Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when <span class="tag lineNumber">50750</span><br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―Perhaps you can tell me,</p> he said, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>why he pours his soul so <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at <br>
            the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the <span class="tag lineNumber">50755</span><br>
            roll, and then said flatly: <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cranly</span>―A sugar!<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>"&gt;―Quis est in malo humore,</p> said Stephen, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>ego aut vos?<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his <br>
            judgment and repeated with the same flat force: <span class="tag lineNumber">50760</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Cranly</span>―A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen won- <br>
            dered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over <br>
            his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of <br>
            hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as <span class="tag lineNumber">50765</span><br>
            he had seen many an other, feeling its heaviness depress his <br>
            heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare <br>
            phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of <br>
            Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin <br>
            given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of <span class="tag lineNumber">50770</span><br>
            the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a <span class="hide">52.979861 -6.048263</span>Wicklow <br>
            pulpit.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann <br>
            marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―Here you are! said MacCann cheerily.<span class="tag lineNumber">50775</span><br> </p>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk <span class="tag lineNumber">50780</span><br>
            chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket. <br>
            A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A <br>
            lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face <br>
            between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase <br>
            and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist <span class="tag lineNumber">50785</span><br>

            walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students <br>
            saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They <span class="tag lineNumber">50930</span><br>
            walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen <br>
            could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks <br>

            The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscu- <span class="tag lineNumber">50965</span><br>
            lar frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's <br>
            body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his <br>
            hands delightedly over  his groins. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―Lynch is awake, said Cranly.<br></p> </p>

            When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, <br>
            panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the <br>
            game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign too?<br></p> </p>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―Repeat, said Lynch.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen repeated the definitions slowly. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in <span class="hide">51.507351 -0.127758</span> <span class="tag lineNumber">51095</span><br>
            London. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she <br>
            had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft <br>
            of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a <br>
            star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart. <br>
            She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It <span class="tag lineNumber">51100</span><br>
            is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms <br>
            of my definitions.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, <br>
            towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of <br>
            it. You see I use the word <span class="emph">arrest</span>. I mean that the tragic emotion <span class="tag lineNumber">51105</span><br>
            is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings ex- <br>
            cited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire <br>
            urges us to possess, to go to something, loathing  urges us to <br>
            abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. <br>
            The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are <span class="tag lineNumber">51110</span><br>
            therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general <br>
            term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above <br>
            desire and loathing.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told <br>
            you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of <span class="tag lineNumber">51115</span><br>
            the Venus of Praxiteles in the <span class="hide">53.339706 -6.252188</span>Museum. Was that not desire?<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again <span class="tag lineNumber">51120</span><br>
            rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them <br>
            from his pockets. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―O I did! I did! he cried.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him <br>
            for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his <span class="tag lineNumber">51125</span><br>
            laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long <br>
            slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought <br>
            before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, <br>
            too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, <br>
            humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny <span class="tag lineNumber">51130</span><br>
            human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and <br>
            selfembittered. <br>
              <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>―As for that,</p> Stephen said in polite parenthesis, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen</span>we are all <br>
            animals. I also am an animal.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―You are, said Lynch.<span class="tag lineNumber">51135</span><br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>"&gt;―But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. <br>
            The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are <br>
            really not esthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic <br>
            in character but also because they are not more than physical. <br>
            Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the <span class="tag lineNumber">51140</span><br>
            stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nerv- <br>
            ous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is <br>
            about to enter our eye.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―Not always, said Lynch critically.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>"&gt;―In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the <span class="tag lineNumber">51145</span><br>
            stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex <br>
            action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot <br>
            awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which <br>
            is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, <br>
            or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal <span class="tag lineNumber">51150</span><br>
            terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by <br>
            what I call the rhythm of beauty.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―What is that exactly? asked Lynch.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of <br>
            part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its <span class="tag lineNumber">51155</span><br>
            part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a <br>
            part.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing <br>
            slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve. <br></p>

            express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it <br>
            brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the <br>
            prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come <br>

            sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their heads <br>
            seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought. <br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded <br>
            wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the <br>
            matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his <br>
            temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat <span class="tag lineNumber">51180</span><br>
            devils of pigs.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or <br>
            intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs <br>
            and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said: <span class="tag lineNumber">51185</span><br>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least <br>
            another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about <br>

            hundred a year. You can't get me one.<br></p> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the <span class="tag lineNumber">51190</span><br>
            last one that remained, saying simply: <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehen- <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Lynch nodded. <span class="tag lineNumber">51195</span><br>
              <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Lynch</span>―I remember that,</p> he said. <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Lynch</span>Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―He uses the word visa, said Stephen, to cover esthetic appre- <br>
            hension of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or <br>
            through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though <br>
            it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which <span class="tag lineNumber">51200</span><br>
            excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a <br>
            kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the <br>
            mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the <br>
            hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―No, said Lynch. Give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of <span class="tag lineNumber">51205</span><br>
            Praxiteles.<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that <br>
            beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a <br>
            meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld <br>
            by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying <span class="tag lineNumber">51210</span><br>
            relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination <br>
            which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sen- <br>
            sible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the <br>
            frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act <br>
            itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy <span class="tag lineNumber">51215</span><br>
            rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his <br>
            statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and <br>
            in the same connection belong to and not belong to the same <br>

            stand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend <span class="tag lineNumber">51220</span><br>
            the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?<br> </p>
            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">???</span>―But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with an- <br>

            with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of <br>
            the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than <br>
            even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. <br>
            It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of <span class="tag lineNumber">51235</span><br>
            the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with <br>

            new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of <br>
            Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring <br>
            and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would <span class="tag lineNumber">51240</span><br>

            which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a <br>
            bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An <span class="tag lineNumber">51360</span><br>
            esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. <br>
            What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented <br>
            in space. But temporal or spatial the esthetic image is first <br>
            luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained <br>
            upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is <span class="tag lineNumber">51365</span><br>
            not it. You apprehend it as <span class="emph">one</span> thing. You see it as one whole. <br>

            words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the <br>
            analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is <span class="emph">one</span> thing <br>
            you feel now that it is a <span class="emph">thing</span>. You apprehend it as complex, <br>
            multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of <span class="tag lineNumber">51375</span><br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―The connotation of the word,</p> Stephen said, <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>is rather vague. <br>
            Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me <span class="tag lineNumber">51380</span><br>
            for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in <br>
            mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty <br>
            being a light from some other world, the idea of which the <br>
            matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the <br>
            symbol. I thought he might mean that claritas is the artistic <span class="tag lineNumber">51385</span><br>
            discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything <br>
            or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic <br>
            image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. <br>
            But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have <br>
            apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed it <span class="tag lineNumber">51390</span><br>
            according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make <br>
            the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permiss- <br>
            ible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. <br>
            The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic quidditas, the <br>
            <span class="emph">whatness</span> of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist <span class="tag lineNumber">51395</span><br>
            when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. <br>
            The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully <br>
            to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of <br>
            beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended <br>
            luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole- <span class="tag lineNumber">51400</span><br>
            ness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis <br>
            of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac <br>
            condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a <br>
            phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment <br>
            of the heart.<span class="tag lineNumber">51405</span><br></p> </p>

            literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. <br>
            When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our <br>
            judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by <br>
            the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between <br>
            the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or senses <span class="tag lineNumber">51415</span><br>
            of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art <br>
            necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one <br>
            to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein <br>
            the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; <br>
            the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in <span class="tag lineNumber">51420</span><br>
            mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, <br>
            the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to <br>

            <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of <span class="tag lineNumber">51440</span><br>
            statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the <br>
            forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even <br>
            in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are <br>
            often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal <br>
            vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages <span class="tag lineNumber">51445</span><br>
            ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged <br>
            stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the <br>
            instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The <br>
            simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature <br>
            when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre <span class="tag lineNumber">51450</span><br>
            of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of <br>
            emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and <br>
            from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The <br>
            personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing <br>
            round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. <span class="tag lineNumber">51455</span><br>
            This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad <br>
            <span class="emph">Turpin Hero</span> which begins in the first person and ends in the <br>
            third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality <br>
            which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every <br>
            person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper <span class="tag lineNumber">51460</span><br>
            and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist at first <br>
            a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent <br>
            narrative finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises <br>
            itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is <br>
            life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. <span class="tag lineNumber">51465</span><br>
            The mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accom- <br>
            plished. The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within <br>
            or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined <br>
            out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.<br> </p>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was <br>
            all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light <br>
            had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, <span class="tag lineNumber">51525</span><br>
            conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to <br>
            a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A <br>
            spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving <br>
            as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly <br>
            as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His <span class="tag lineNumber">51530</span><br>
            soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that <br>
            windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants <br>
            open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In <br>
            dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. <span class="tag lineNumber">51535</span><br>
            Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and days <br>
            and years and ages?<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from <br>
            all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of <br>
            what had happened or of what might have happened. The in- <span class="tag lineNumber">51540</span><br>
            stant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on <br>
            cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling softly <br>
            its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the <br>
            word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the <br>
            virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, <span class="tag lineNumber">51545</span><br>
            whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and <br>
            ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful <br>
            heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful <br>
            from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that <br>
            ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling <span class="tag lineNumber">51550</span><br>
            from heaven.<br> </p>
            <p class="lg">
              Are you not weary of ardent ways, <br>

            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring <span class="tag lineNumber">51555</span><br>
            them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass <br>
            through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; <br>
            ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, <br>
            consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose <br>
            that was her wilful heart.<span class="tag lineNumber">51560</span><br> </p>

            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to <br>
            move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the <span class="tag lineNumber">51565</span><br>
            altar of the world.<br> </p>
            <p class="lg">
              Above the flame the smoke of praise <br>
              Goes up from ocean rim to rim. <br>
              Tell no more of enchanted days. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury <span class="tag lineNumber">51570</span><br>
            oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging <br>
            swaying smoking [swaying] censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball. <br>
            The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. <br>
            His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then <br>
            went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and <span class="tag lineNumber">51575</span><br>
            baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes <br>
            of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell <br>
            beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three. <br>
            The bell and the birds ceased: and the dull white light  spread <span class="tag lineNumber">51580</span><br>
            itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight <br>
            in his heart.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to <br>
            look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only <br>
            the soup plate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the <span class="tag lineNumber">51585</span><br>
            candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket, <br>
            singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards <br>
            the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the <br>
            coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a <br>
            cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet, <span class="tag lineNumber">51590</span><br>
            placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began to <br>
            write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the <br>
            rough cardboard surface.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, <br>
            murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his <span class="tag lineNumber">51595</span><br>
            head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the <br>
            sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious, <br>
            asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with <br>
            himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the <br>
            untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the <span class="tag lineNumber">51600</span><br>
            talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw <br>
            himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its <br>
            speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again <br>
            in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty <br>
            song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the <span class="tag lineNumber">51605</span><br>
            victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves. <br>
            While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart <br>
            was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he <br>
            heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own <br>
            sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their chris- <span class="tag lineNumber">51610</span><br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he <br>
            had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his <br>

            white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She <span class="tag lineNumber">51615</span><br>
            danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, <br>
            as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was <br>
            on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had <br>

            shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.<br> </p>
            <p class="textParagraph"> A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the <br>

            <p class="textParagraph"> Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy <span class="tag lineNumber">51645</span><br>

            perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon <br>

            self bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a <br>
            figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking <br>

            that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the <br>
            blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of <br>

              <p class="textParagraph">What birds were they?<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph">He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning <br>
              wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting <span class="tag lineNumber">51770</span><br>
              shoulder of a house in <span class="hide">53.340809 -6.257636</span>Molesworth Street. The air of the late <br>
              March evening made clear their flight, their dark darting <br>
              quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a <br>
              limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He watched their flight: bird after bird: a dark flash, a <span class="tag lineNumber">51775</span><br>
              swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings. <br>
              He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies <br>
              passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in <br>
              number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from <br>
              the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round <span class="tag lineNumber">51780</span><br>
              and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left <br>
              to right, circling about a temple of air.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He  listened to their cries: like the squeak of mice behind the <br>
              wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and <br>
              shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a <span class="tag lineNumber">51785</span><br>
              fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry <br>
              was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken <br>
              light unwound from whirring spools.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his <br>
              mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the <span class="tag lineNumber">51790</span><br>
              dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerv- <br>
              ing round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes <br>
              which still saw the image of his mother's face.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, <br>
              hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an <span class="tag lineNumber">51795</span><br>
              augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew <br>
              through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shape- <br>
              less thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds <br>
              to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air <br>
              have their knowledge and know their times and seasons be- <span class="tag lineNumber">51800</span><br>
              cause they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have <br>
              not perverted that order by reason.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at <br>
              birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think <br>
              vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he <span class="tag lineNumber">51805</span><br>
              leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear <br>
              of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of <br>
              symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he <br>
              bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of <br>
              Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet <span class="tag lineNumber">51810</span><br>
              and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him <br>
              think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a <br>
              document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he <br>
              would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like <span class="tag lineNumber">51815</span><br>
              an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was <br>
              about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into <br>
              which he had been born and the order of life out of which he <br>
              had come?<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of <span class="tag lineNumber">51820</span><br>
              the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were <br>
              they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come <br>
              back from the south. Then he was to go away? for they were <br>
              birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home <br>
              under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes <span class="tag lineNumber">51825</span><br>
              they had built to wander.<br> </p>
              <p class="lg">
                Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel. <br>
                I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes <br>

              <p class="textParagraph"> A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over <br>
              his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent <br>
              spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic si- <br>
              lence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing <br>
              waters.<span class="tag lineNumber">51835</span><br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft <br>

              mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry: and he <br>
              felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds <span class="tag lineNumber">51840</span><br>
              and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his <br>
              heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly.<br> </p>

              looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls <br>
              and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the <br>
              garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind <br>
              him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls <span class="tag lineNumber">51850</span><br>
              and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall <br>

              He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a <br>

              <p class="textParagraph"> The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and <br>

              their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly impelled by the <span class="tag lineNumber">51925</span><br>
              grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing <br>
              lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his <br>
              arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped <br>
              athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was <br>

              The brother's face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair. <br>

              <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">Stephen Dedalus</span>―Is it?</p> Stephen said vaguely.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up <br>

              over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient <br>
              of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in <span class="tag lineNumber">52050</span><br>
              salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his <br>
              forehead like an iron crown.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed <br>
              across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there <br>

              Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh com- <br>

              phen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in <span class="tag lineNumber">52060</span><br>
              himself towards himself. And he remembered an evening when <br>
              he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray <br>
              to God in a wood near <span class="hide">53.450924 -6.150138</span>Malahide. He had lifted up his arms <br>
              and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing <br>
              that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when <span class="tag lineNumber">52065</span><br>
              two constabularymen had come into sight round a bend in the <br>
              gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an <br>
              air from the last pantomime.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the <br>

              The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell <br>
              again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air <br>
              and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes <br>
              were sleeping.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was <span class="tag lineNumber">52075</span><br>
              silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues <br>

              <p class="textParagraph"> A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy <br>

              air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, <br>
              rich and lutelike?<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the <br>
              end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to <br>
              hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and <span class="tag lineNumber">52085</span><br>
              allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland <br>

              <p class="textParagraph"> Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed <br>

              shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a <br>
              slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory <br>
              ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan: <br>
              and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in <span class="hide">51.511732 -0.123270</span>Covent <br>

              the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, <br>
              gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.<br> </p>
              <p class="textParagraph"> The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They <br>
              were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by <br>
              them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the <span class="tag lineNumber">52100</span><br>
              way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust <br>

              a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music <br>

              illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sud- <span class="tag lineNumber">52120</span><br>

              bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as <br>
              they fell. Yes: and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It <br>

              sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a <br>
              leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards <br>

              with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the um- <br>

              fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging <br>
              across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and <br>

              Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the <br>
              hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front <br>
              stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back <br>
              at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined <br>
              the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They <span class="tag lineNumber">52260</span><br>
              thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted <br>
              them along the roads  in the country: they knew the names of <br>
              certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched <br>

              their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts <br>
              and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats <br>
              across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the edges of <span class="tag lineNumber">52270</span><br>
              streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had waited <br>
              in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering <br>
              him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed: for Davin <br>
              had the mild eyes of one that could be secret. But him no <br>

              slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and <br>
              high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the <br>
              first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of <br>
              the first chanting of the passion: <br>
              <p class="dialog"><span class="tag dialog">a female servant</span>―Et tu cum Jesu Galilaeo eras.<span class="tag lineNumber">52490</span><br></p> </p>
