<p> <lb n="30001"/>The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after
<lb n="30002"/>its dull day and@ as he stared through the dull square of the
<lb n="30003"/>window of the schoolroom@ he felt his belly crave for its food.
<lb n="30004"/>He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots
<lb n="30005"/>and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in
<lb n="30006"/>thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly
<lb n="30007"/>counselled him.</p>
<p> <lb n="30008"/>It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the
<lb n="30009"/>yellow lamps would light up@ here and there@ the squalid quarter
<lb n="30010"/>of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down
<lb n="30011"/>the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear
<lb n="30012"/>and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
<lb n="30013"/>The whores would be just coming out of their houses making
<lb n="30014"/>ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling
<lb n="30015"/>the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them
<lb n="30016"/>calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a
<lb n="30017"/>sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumed flesh.
<lb n="30018"/>Yet as he prowled in quest of that call@ his senses, stultified only
<lb n="30019"/>by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded and@ shamed
<lb n="30020"/>them,@ his eyes@ a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a
<lb n="30021"/>photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy
<lb n="30022"/>playbill,@ his ears@ the drawling jargon of greeting:
<lb n="30023"> <said who="a whore">--Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?</said>
<lb n="30024"> <said who="a whore">--Is that you, pigeon?</said>
<lb n="30025"> <said who="a whore">--Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.</said>
<lb n="30026"> <said who="a whore">--Goodnight,@ husband! Coming in to have a short time?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30027"/>The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread
<lb n="30028"/>out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's:@ and@
<lb n="30029"/>when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated@ be-
<lb n="30030"/>gan slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing
<lb n="30031"/>and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes
<lb n="30032"/>opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched.
<lb n="30033"/>The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary  mind outward to its
<lb n="30034"/>verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying
<lb n="30035"/>him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer
<lb n="30036"/>and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment
<lb n="30037"/>upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
<lb n="30038"/>The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell
<lb n="30039"/>through space.</p>
<p> <lb n="30040"/>The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon an-
<lb n="30041"/>other equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread
<lb n="30042"/>abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to
<lb n="30043"/>experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the
<lb n="30044"/>balefire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading
<lb n="30045"/>slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were
<lb n="30046"/>quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.</p>
<p> <lb n="30047"/>A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first
<lb n="30048"/>violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and
<lb n="30049"/>had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
<lb n="30050"/>Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of
<lb n="30051"/>himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or
<lb n="30052"/>soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established
<lb n="30053"/>between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished
<lb n="30054"/>itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had
<lb n="30055"/>sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that,
<lb n="30056"/>while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin
<lb n="30057"/>alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his
<lb n="30058"/>punishment. His days and works and thoughts could make no
<lb n="30059"/>atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having
<lb n="30060"/>ceased to refresh his soul. At most@ by an alms given to a
<lb n="30061"/>beggar,@ whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to
<lb n="30062"/>win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had
<lb n="30063"/>gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that
<lb n="30064"/>his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a
<lb n="30065"/>certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one
<lb n="30066"/>prayer at night though he knew it was in God's power to take
<lb n="30067"/>away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he
<lb n="30068"/>could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe
<lb n="30069"/>of God@ told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned
<lb n="30070"/>for in whole or in part by a false homage to the Allseeing and
<lb n="30071">Allknowing. <said who="a voice">--Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my
<lb n="30073"/>stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what
<lb n="30074"/>a surd is?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30075"/>The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of
<lb n="30076"/>his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On
<lb n="30077"/>Sunday mornings as he passed the churchdoor he glanced
<lb n="30078"/>coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep,
<lb n="30079"/>outside the church, morally present at the mass which they
<lb n="30080"/>could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell
<lb n="30081"/>of the cheap hairoil with which they had anointed their heads
<lb n="30082"/>repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the
<lb n="30083"/>evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which
<lb n="30084"/>he could cajole so easily.</p>
<p> <lb n="30085"/>On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the
<lb n="30086"/>certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the
<lb n="30087"/>Blessed Virgin Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality
<lb n="30088"/>met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a
<lb n="30089"/>cushioned kneelingdesk at the right of the altar from which he
<lb n="30090"/>led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of
<lb n="30091"/>his position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse
<lb n="30092"/>to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all
<lb n="30093"/>his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces
<lb n="30094"/>restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed
<lb n="30095"/>his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive:
<lb n="30096"/>spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolising the
<lb n="30097"/>preciousness of God's gifts to her soul, rich garments, symbol-
<lb n="30098"/>ising her royal lineage, her emblems, the lateflowering plant
<lb n="30099"/>and lateblossoming tree, symbolising the agelong gradual
<lb n="30100"/>growth of her cultus among men. When it fell to him to read
<lb n="30101"/>the lesson towards the close of the office he read it in a veiled
<lb n="30102"/>voice, lulling his conscience to its music:</p>
<lg>
<p> <lb n="30103"/><emph>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cu-
<lb n="30104"/>pressus in  monte Sion. Quasi palma exaltata sum in
<lb n="30105"/>Gades et quasi  plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva
<lb n="30106"/>speciosa in campis et  quasi platanus exaltata sum juxta
<lb n="30107"/>aquam in plateis. Sicut  cinnamomum et balsamum aro-
<lb n="30108"/>matizans odorem dedi et quasi  myrrha electa dedi
<lb n="30109"/>suavitatem odoris.</emph></p>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="30110"/>His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had
<lb n="30111"/>led him nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to
<lb n="30112"/>regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing
<lb n="30113"/>faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who
<lb n="30114"/>approached her. If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him
<lb n="30115"/>and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be
<lb n="30116"/>her knight. If ever his soul, reentering her dwelling shyly after
<lb n="30117"/>the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned to-
<lb n="30118"/>wards her whose emblem is the morning star, <emph>bright and</emph>
<lb n="30119"/><emph>musical, telling of heaven and infusing peace</emph>, it was when her
<lb n="30120"/>names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lin-
<lb n="30121"/>gered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.</p>
<p> <lb n="30122"/>That was strange. He tried to think how it could be but the
<lb n="30123"/>dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thought.@
<lb n="30124"/>The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done
<lb n="30125"/>for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began
<lb n="30126"/>to hum tunelessly:</p>
<p> <lb n="30127"/><emph>My excellent friend Bombados.</emph>
<p> <lb n="30128"/>Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
<lb n="30129"> <said who="Ennis">--The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.</said></p>
<lb n="30130"/>A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
<lb n="30131"> <said who="a tall boy">--That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be
<lb n="30132"/>in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the
<lb n="30133"/>catechism, Dedalus.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30134"/>Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler,
<lb n="30135"/>listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time
<lb n="30136"/>to time by saying:
<lb n="30137"> <said who="Vincent Heron">--Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket!</said></p>
<lb n="30138"/>It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in follow-
<lb n="30139"/>ing up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church
<lb n="30140"/>and penetrating into obscure silences  only to hear and feel the
<lb n="30141"/>more deeply his own condemnation. The sentence of saint
<lb n="30142"/>James which says that he who offends against one command-
<lb n="30143"/>ment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen
<lb n="30144"/>phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own
<lb n="30145"/>state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins had sprung
<lb n="30146"/>forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in
<lb n="30147"/>using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasure, envy of
<lb n="30148"/>those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious
<lb n="30149"/>murmuring against the pious, gluttonous  enjoyment of food,
<lb n="30150"/>the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his
<lb n="30151"/>longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his
<lb n="30152"/>whole being had sunk.</p>
<p> <lb n="30153"/>As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd
<lb n="30154"/>harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious
<lb n="30155"/>questions proposed to it. If a man had stolen a pound in his
<lb n="30156"/>youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how
<lb n="30157"/>much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen
<lb n="30158"/>only or the pound together with the compound interest accru-
<lb n="30159"/>ing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving
<lb n="30160"/>baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child
<lb n="30161"/>baptised? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it
<lb n="30162"/>that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven
<lb n="30163"/>to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the
<lb n="30164"/>meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the sacrament
<lb n="30165"/>of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and
<lb n="30166"/>wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divin-
<lb n="30167"/>ity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a tiny
<lb n="30168"/>particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and
<lb n="30169"/>blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If
<lb n="30170"/>the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble  into cor-
<lb n="30171"/>ruption after they have been consecrated is Jesus Christ still
<lb n="30172"/>present under their species as God and as man?
<lb n="30173"> <said who="a boy">--Here he is! Here he is!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30174"/>A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come
<lb n="30175"/>from the house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads
<lb n="30176"/>bent upon them silently. The rector entered and took his seat
<lb n="30177"/>on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind
<lb n="30178"/>urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.</p>
<p> <lb n="30179"/>The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson
<lb n="30180"/>from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said:
<lb n="30181"> <said who="Father Conmee">--The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of
<lb n="30182"/>saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat
<lb n="30183"/>will go on from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confessions@
<lb n="30184"/>will be heard all the afternoon after beads. If any boys have
<lb n="30185"/>special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to
<lb n="30186"/>change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and
<lb n="30187"/>general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be a
<lb n="30188"/>free day. Sunday of course. But Saturday and Sunday being free
<lb n="30189"/>days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a
<lb n="30190"/>free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think you,
<lb n="30191"/>Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.</said>
<lb n="30192"> <said who="Lawless">--I, sir? Why,  sir?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30193"/>A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of
<lb n="30194"/>boys from the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly
<lb n="30195"/>to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.</p>
<p> <lb n="30196"/>The rector went on gravely:
<lb n="30197"> <said who="Father Conmee">--You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis
<lb n="30198"/>Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an
<lb n="30199"/>old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he
<lb n="30200"/>was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in <place><location><geo>48.853157 2.343094</geo></location>
<lb n="30201"/><placeName>Paris</placeName></place> where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the
<lb n="30202"/>university. This young and brilliant nobleman and man of let-
<lb n="30203"/>ters entered heart and soul into the ideas of our glorious
<lb n="30204"/>founder@ and you know that he, at his own desire, was sent by
<lb n="30205"/>saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you
<lb n="30206"/>know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to
<lb n="30207"/>country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan,
<lb n="30208"/>baptising the people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten
<lb n="30209"/>thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm
<lb n="30210"/>had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the
<lb n="30211"/>heads of those whom he baptised. He wished then to go to
<lb n="30212"/>China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on
<lb n="30213"/>the <place><location><geo>21.705010 112.791206</geo></location><placeName>island of Sancian</placeName></place>. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A
<lb n="30214"/>great soldier of God!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30215"/>The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands be-
<lb n="30216"/>fore him, went on:
<lb n="30217"> <said who="Father Conmee">--He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thou-
<lb n="30218"/>sand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true
<lb n="30219"/>conqueror, true to the motto of our order@ <seg xml:lang="la">ad majorem Dei
<lb n="30220"/>gloriam</seg>! A saint who has great power in heaven, remember:
<lb n="30221"/>power to intercede for us in our grief, power to obtain what-
<lb n="30222"/>ever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls, power above
<lb n="30223"/>all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great
<lb n="30224"/>saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30225"/>He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them
<lb n="30226"/>against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his
<lb n="30227"/>listeners out of his dark stern eyes.</p>
<p> <lb n="30228"/>In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny
<lb n="30229"/>glow. Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the
<lb n="30230"/>desert that feels the simoom  coming from afar.</p>

<p> <lb n="30236"/>Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall
<lb n="30237"/>sat at a table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoul-
<lb n="30238"/>ders a heavy cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice
<lb n="30239"/>broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so strangely
<lb n="30240"/>rearisen, brought back to Stephen's mind his life at <place><location><geo>53.310624 -6.684096</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>:
<lb n="30241"/>the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys, the square ditch,

<lb n="30243"/>dreamed of being buried, the firelight on the wall of the infirm-
<lb n="30244"/>ary where he lay sick, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.
<lb n="30245"/>His soul, as these memories came back to him, became again a
<lb n="30246"/>child's soul.
<lb n="30247"> <said who="Father Arnall">--We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in
<lb n="30248"/>Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of
<lb n="30249"/>the outer world to celebrate and to honour one of the greatest
<lb n="30250"/>of saints, the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your
<lb n="30251"/>college, saint Francis Xavier. Year after year for much longer
<lb n="30252"/>than any of you, my dear little boys, can remember or than I
<lb n="30253"/>can remember the boys of this college have met in this very
<lb n="30254"/>chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their
<lb n="30255"/>patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its changes.
<lb n="30256"/>Even in the last few years what changes can most of you not
<lb n="30257"/>remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front benches a
<lb n="30258"/>few short@ years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in the
<lb n="30259"/>burning tropics or immersed in professional duties or in sem-
<lb n="30260"/>inaries or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may
<lb n="30261"/>be, already called by the great God to another life and to the
<lb n="30262"/>rendering up of their stewardship. And still as the years roll by,
<lb n="30263"/>bringing with them changes for good and bad, the memory of
<lb n="30264"/>the great saint is honoured by the boys of his college who make
<lb n="30265"/>every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast
<lb n="30266"/>day set apart by our holy mother  the church to transmit to all
<lb n="30267"/>the ages the name and fame of one of the greatest sons of
<lb n="30268"/>catholic Spain.</said>
<lb n="30269"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Now what is the meaning of this word <emph>retreat</emph> and why is it
<lb n="30270"/>allowed on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who
<lb n="30271"/>desire to lead before God and in the eyes of men a truly chris-
<lb n="30272"/>tian life? A retreat, my dear boys, signifies a withdrawal for a
<lb n="30273"/>while from the cares of our life, the cares of this workaday
<lb n="30274"/>world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to
<lb n="30275"/>reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to understand
<lb n="30276"/>better why we are here in this world. During these few days I
<lb n="30277"/>intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four
<lb n="30278"/>last things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death,
<lb n="30279"/>judgment, hell and heaven. We shall try to understand them
<lb n="30280"/>fully during these few days so that we may derive from the
<lb n="30281"/>understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And re-
<lb n="30282"/>member, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world
<lb n="30283"/>for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's holy will
<lb n="30284"/>and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One thing
<lb n="30285"/>alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it profit
<lb n="30286"/>a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his
<lb n="30287"/>immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in
<lb n="30288"/>this wretched world that can make up for such a loss.</said>
<lb n="30289"> <said who="Father Arnall">--I will ask you therefore, my dear boys, to put away from
<lb n="30290"/>your minds during these few days all worldly thoughts,
<lb n="30291"/>whether of study or pleasure or ambition, and to give all your
<lb n="30292"/>attention to the state of your souls. I need hardly remind you
<lb n="30293"/>that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to
<lb n="30294"/>preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud
<lb n="30295"/>unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will see that this
<lb n="30296"/>custom is not infringed and I look especially to the prefects and
<lb n="30297"/>officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the sodality
<lb n="30298"/>of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellowstu-
<lb n="30299"/>dents.</said></p>
<lb n="30300"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint
<lb n="30301"/>Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's bless-
<lb n="30302"/>ing will then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and
<lb n="30303"/>beyond all, let this retreat be one to which you can look back in
<lb n="30304"/>after years when maybe you are far from this college and
<lb n="30305"/>among very different surroundings, to which you can look back
<lb n="30306"/>with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having
<lb n="30307"/>granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a
<lb n="30308"/>pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, as may so
<lb n="30309"/>happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor soul
<lb n="30310"/>which@ has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy
<lb n="30311"/>grace and to fall into grievous sin I fervently trust and pray that
<lb n="30312"/>this retreat may be the turningpoint in the life of that soul. I
<lb n="30313"/>pray to God  through the merits of His@ zealous servant Francis
<lb n="30314"/>Xavier that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and
<lb n="30315"/>that the holy communion on saint Francis' day of this year may
<lb n="30316"/>be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and
<lb n="30317"/>unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a mem-
<lb n="30318"/>orable one.</said>
<lb n="30319"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your
<lb n="30320"/>pious attention, by your own devotion, by your outward de-
<lb n="30321"/>meanour. Banish from your minds all worldly thoughts and
<lb n="30322"/>think only of the last things, death, judgment, hell and heaven.
<lb n="30323"/>He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin
<lb n="30324"/>for ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think
<lb n="30325"/>with them always before his eyes. He will live a good life and
<lb n="30326"/>die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has sacri-
<lb n="30327"/>ficed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a
<lb n="30328"/>hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the
<lb n="30329"/>kingdom without end &ndash;@ a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish
<lb n="30330"/>you from my heart;@ one and all, in the name of the Father and
<lb n="30331"/>of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30332"/>As he walked home with silent companions a thick fog
<lb n="30333"/>seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it
<lb n="30334"/>should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner
<lb n="30335"/>with surly appetite and, when the meal was over and the
<lb n="30336"/>greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and
<lb n="30337"/>went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth
<lb n="30338"/>with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to
<lb n="30339"/>the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the
<lb n="30340"/>end:@ and a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his
<lb n="30341"/>mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and
<lb n="30342"/>gazed out into the darkening street. Forms passed this way and
<lb n="30343"/>that way@ through the dull light. And that was life. The letters
<lb n="30344"/>of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one
<lb n="30345"/>another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence.
<lb n="30346"/>His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease,
<lb n="30347"/>plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening
<lb n="30348"/>dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishon-
<lb n="30349"/>oured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed and
<lb n="30350"/>human for a bovine god to stare upon.</p>
<p> <lb n="30351"/>The next day brought death and judgment, stirring his soul
<lb n="30352"/>slowly from its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear be-
<lb n="30353"/>came a terror of spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew
<lb n="30354"/>death into his soul. He suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill
<lb n="30355"/>touch the extremities and creep onward towards the heart, the
<lb n="30356"/>film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain
<lb n="30357"/>extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon
<lb n="30358"/>the skin, the powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech
<lb n="30359"/>thickening and wandering and failing, the heart throbbing
<lb n="30360"/>faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the breath, the
<lb n="30361"/>poor timid@ breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and
<lb n="30362"/>sighing, gurgling  and rattling in the throat. No help! No help!
<lb n="30363"/>He, he himself, his body to which he had yielded was dying.
<lb n="30364"/>Into the grave with it! Nail it down into a wooden box, the
<lb n="30365"/>corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of hirelings.
<lb n="30366"/>Thrust it out of men's sight into a long hole in the ground, into
<lb n="30367"/>the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its creeping worms and to
<lb n="30368"/>be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats.</p>
<p> <lb n="30369"/>And while the friends were still standing in tears by the
<lb n="30370"/>bedside the soul of the sinner was judged. At the last moment
<lb n="30371"/>of consciousness the whole earthly life passed before the vision
<lb n="30372"/>of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the body had died and
<lb n="30373"/>the soul stood terrified before the judgmentseat. God, who had
<lb n="30374"/>long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been
<lb n="30375"/>patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent,
<lb n="30376"/>sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time was to sin
<lb n="30377"/>and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at  the warnings of
<lb n="30378"/>His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey His@
<lb n="30379"/>commands, to hoodwink one's fellow men, to commit sin after
<lb n="30380"/>sin and sin after sin and to hide one's corruption from the sight
<lb n="30381"/>of men. But that time was over. Now it was God's turn: and He
<lb n="30382"/>was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every sin would then
<lb n="30383"/>come forth from its lurkingplace, the most rebellious against
<lb n="30384"/>the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt
<lb n="30385"/>nature, the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity.
<lb n="30386"/>What did it avail then to have been a great emperor, a great
<lb n="30387"/>general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the learned?
<lb n="30388"/>All were as one before the judgmentseat of God. He would
<lb n="30389"/>reward the good and punish the wicked. One single instant was
<lb n="30390"/>enough for the trial of a man's soul. One single instant after the
<lb n="30391"/>body's death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The
<lb n="30392"/>particular judgment was over and the soul had passed to the
<lb n="30393"/>abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled
<lb n="30394"/>howling into hell.</p>
<p> <lb n="30395"/>Nor was that all. God's justice had still to be vindicated
<lb n="30396"/>before men: after the particular there still remained the general
<lb n="30397"/>judgment. The last day had come. The@ doomsday@ was at hand.
<lb n="30398"/>The stars of heaven were falling upon the earth like the figs
<lb n="30399"/>cast by the figtree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the
<lb n="30400"/>great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of
<lb n="30401"/>hair. The moon was bloodred. The firmament was as a scroll
<lb n="30402"/>rolled away. The archangel Michael, the prince of the heavenly
<lb n="30403"/>host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With one
<lb n="30404"/>foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the
<lb n="30405"/>archangelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three
<lb n="30406"/>blasts of the angel filled all the universe. Time is, time was but
<lb n="30407"/>time shall be no more. At the last blast the souls of universal
<lb n="30408"/>humanity throng towards the valley of Jehoshaphat, rich and
<lb n="30409"/>poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and wicked.
<lb n="30410"/>The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls
<lb n="30411"/>of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of
<lb n="30412"/>Adam, all are assembled on that supreme day. And lo the
<lb n="30413"/>supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God,
<lb n="30414"/>no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of
<lb n="30415"/>Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd,  He is seen now coming
<lb n="30416"/>upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by nine
<lb n="30417"/>choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers
<lb n="30418"/>and virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim,
<lb n="30419"/>God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is
<lb n="30420"/>heard even at the farthest limits of space, even in the bottom-
<lb n="30421"/>less abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will be and
<lb n="30422"/>can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side@ bidding them
<lb n="30423"/>enter into the kingdom, the eternity of bliss@ prepared for them.
<lb n="30424"/>The unjust He casts from Him, crying in His offended majesty:
<lb n="30425"/><emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which was</emph>
<lb n="30426"/><emph>prepared for the devil and his angels.</emph> O what agony then for
<lb n="30427"/>the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children are torn
<lb n="30428"/>from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner
<lb n="30429"/>holds out his arms to those who were dear and near@ to him in
<lb n="30430"/>this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he
<lb n="30431"/>made a mock of, to those who counselled him and tried to lead
<lb n="30432"/>him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister, to
<lb n="30433"/>the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too
<lb n="30434"/>late: the just turn away from the wretched damned souls which
<lb n="30435"/>now appear before the eyes of all in their hideous and evil
<lb n="30436"/>character. O you hypocrites, O you whited sepulchres, O you
<lb n="30437"/>who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul
<lb n="30438"/>within is a foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that
<lb n="30439"/>terrible day?</p>
<p> <lb n="30440"/>And this day will come, shall come, must come:@ the day of
<lb n="30441"/>death and the day of judgment. It is appointed unto man to die
<lb n="30442"/>and after death the judgment. Death is certain. The time and
<lb n="30443"/>manner are uncertain,  whether from long disease or from some
<lb n="30444"/>unexpected accident:@ the Son of God cometh at an hour when
<lb n="30445"/>you little expect Him. Be therefore ready every moment, seeing
<lb n="30446"/>that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all.
<lb n="30447"/>Death and judgment, brought into the world by the sin of our
<lb n="30448"/>first parents, are the dark portals that close our earthly exist-
<lb n="30449"/>ence, the portals that open into the unknown and the unseen,
<lb n="30450"/>portals through which every soul must pass, alone, unaided
<lb n="30451"/>save by its good works, without friend or  brother or parents@ or
<lb n="30452"/>master to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever
<lb n="30453"/>before our minds and then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of
<lb n="30454"/>terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment for him who has
<lb n="30455"/>walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in
<lb n="30456"/>life, attending to his morning and evening prayers, approaching
<lb n="30457"/>the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and mer-
<lb n="30458"/>ciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just
<lb n="30459"/>man, death is no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great
<lb n="30460"/>English writer, who, when on his deathbed, sent for the wicked
<lb n="30461"/>young earl of Warwick to let him see how a christian can meet
<lb n="30462"/>his end?@ He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian,
<lb n="30463"/>who can say in his heart:</p>
<lg>
<lb n="30464"/>O grave, where is thy victory?
<lb n="30465"/>O death, where is thy sting?
</lg>
<p> <lb n="30466"/>Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and
<lb n="30467"/>secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's
<lb n="30468"/>knife had probed deeply into his diseased conscience and he felt
<lb n="30469"/>now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was
<lb n="30470"/>right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had
<lb n="30471"/>lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet
<lb n="30472"/>had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light.
<lb n="30473"/>The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant
<lb n="30474"/>his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through
<lb n="30475"/>his mind; his sins, the jeweleyed harlots of his imagination, fled
<lb n="30476"/>before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and
<lb n="30477"/>huddled under a mane of hair.</p>
<p> <lb n="30478"/>As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light
<lb n="30479"/>laughter of a girl reached his burning ears.@ The frail gay sound
<lb n="30480"/>smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not
<lb n="30481"/>daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked,
<lb n="30482"/>into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his
<lb n="30483"/>smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma
<lb n="30484"/>appeared before him and, under her eyes, the flood of shame
<lb n="30485"/>rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind
<lb n="30486"/>had subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and
<lb n="30487"/>trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that
<lb n="30488"/>chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank
<lb n="30489"/>under his very nostrils: the sootcoated packet of pictures which
<lb n="30490"/>he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of
<lb n="30491"/>whose shameless or bashful  wantonness he lay for hours sin-
<lb n="30492"/>ning in thought and deed:@ his monstrous dreams, peopled by
<lb n="30493"/>apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes:@ the
<lb n="30494"/>foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession
<lb n="30495"/>and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them
<lb n="30496"/>under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or
<lb n="30497"/>beneath some hingeless door or in some niche in the hedges
<lb n="30498"/>where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read
<lb n="30499"/>them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these
<lb n="30500"/>things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul
<lb n="30501"/>memories condensed within his brain.</p>
<p> <lb n="30502"/>When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to
<lb n="30503"/>raise his soul from its abject powerlessness. God and the
<lb n="30504"/>Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God was too great and
<lb n="30505"/>stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he imagined
<lb n="30506"/>that he stood near Emma in a wide land and,  humbly  and in
<lb n="30507"/>tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.</p>
<p> <lb n="30508"/>In a@ wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud
<lb n="30509"/>drifting westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood
<lb n="30510"/>together, children that had  erred. Their error had offended
<lb n="30511"/>deeply God's majesty,@ though it was the error of two children,
<lb n="30512"/>but it had not offended her whose beauty <emph>is not like earthly</emph>
<lb n="30513"/><emph>beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star</emph>
<lb n="30514"/><emph>which is its emblem, bright and musical</emph>. The eyes were not
<lb n="30515"/>offended which she turned upon them nor reproachful. She
<lb n="30516"/>placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking
<lb n="30517"/>to their hearts:
<lb n="30518"> <said who="Virgin Mary">--Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening
<lb n="30519"/>now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children.
<lb n="30520"/>It is one heart that loves another heart. Take hands together,
<lb n="30521"/>my dear children, and you  will  be happy together and your
<lb n="30522"/>hearts will love each other.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30523"/>The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered
<lb n="30524"/>through the lowered blinds:@ and through the fissure between
<lb n="30525"/>the last blind and the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a
<lb n="30526"/>spear and touched the embossed brasses of the candlesticks
<lb n="30527"/>upon the altar that gleamed like the battleworn mail armour of
<lb n="30528"/>angels.</p>
<p> <lb n="30529"/>Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college.
<lb n="30530"/>It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch
<lb n="30531"/>by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and
<lb n="30532"/>houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. All
<lb n="30533"/>life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants,
<lb n="30534"/>pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the
<lb n="30535"/>wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty nights the rain
<lb n="30536"/>would fall till the waters covered the face of the earth.</p>
<p> <lb n="30537"/>It might be. Why not?
<lb n="30538"> <said who="Father Arnall">--<emph>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without any</emph>
<lb n="30539"/><emph>limits</emph> &ndash; words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus,
<lb n="30540"/>from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the
<lb n="30541"/>name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
<lb n="30542"/>Amen.</p></said></p>
<p> <lb n="30543"/>The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within
<lb n="30544"/>his soutane and, having considered its dial for a moment in
<lb n="30545"/>silence, placed it silently before him on the table.</p>
<p> <lb n="30546"/>He began  to speak in a quiet tone.
<lb n="30547"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first
<lb n="30548"/>parents and you will remember that they were created by God
<lb n="30549"/>in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of
<lb n="30550"/>Lucifer and his rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer,
<lb n="30551"/>we are  told, was a son of the morning, a radiant and mighty
<lb n="30552"/>angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with him a third part of
<lb n="30553"/>the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his rebellious
<lb n="30554"/>angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians
<lb n="30555"/>consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought con-
<lb n="30556"/>ceived in an instant: <emph><seg xml:lang="la">non serviam</seg>: I will not serve</emph>. That instant
<lb n="30557"/>was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the sinful
<lb n="30558"/>thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven into hell
<lb n="30559"/>for ever.</said>
<lb n="30560"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in
<lb n="30561"/>Eden, that lovely garden@ in the plain of Damascus@ that lovely garden@ resplendent
<lb n="30562"/>with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation.
<lb n="30563"/>The fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts and birds were
<lb n="30564"/>their willing servants: they knew not the ills our flesh is heir to,
<lb n="30565"/>disease and poverty and death: all that a great and generous
<lb n="30566"/>God could do for them was done. But there was one condition
<lb n="30567"/>imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were
<lb n="30568"/>not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree.</said>
<lb n="30569"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a
<lb n="30570"/>shining angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend@ came to
<lb n="30571"/>them in the shape of a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of
<lb n="30572"/>the field. He envied them. He, the fallen great one, could not
<lb n="30573"/>bear to think that man, a being of clay, should possess the
<lb n="30574"/>inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came
<lb n="30575"/>to the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his
<lb n="30576"/>eloquence into her ear, promising her @ (O,@ the blasphemy of that
<lb n="30577"/>promise!)@ that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit they
<lb n="30578"/>would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded to the
<lb n="30579"/>wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to
<lb n="30580"/>Adam who had not the moral courage to resist her. The poison
<lb n="30581"/>tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell.</said>
<lb n="30582"> <said who="Father Arnall">--And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling
<lb n="30583"/>His creature man to account: and Michael, prince of the heav-
<lb n="30584"/>enly host, with a sword of flame in his hand appeared before
<lb n="30585"/>the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into the world,
<lb n="30586"/>the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and disappoint-
<lb n="30587"/>ment, of labour and hardship, to earn their bread in the sweat
<lb n="30588"/>of their brow. But even then how merciful was God! He took
<lb n="30589"/>pity on our poor degraded first@ parents and promised that in
<lb n="30590"/>the fulness of time He would send down from heaven One who
<lb n="30591"/>would redeem them, make them once more children of God
<lb n="30592"/>and heirs to the kingdom of heaven: and that One, that
<lb n="30593"/>Redeemer of fallen man, was to be God's onlybegotten  Son, the
<lb n="30594"/>Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word.</said>
<lb n="30595"> <said who="Father Arnall">--He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin
<lb n="30596"/>mother. He was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as
<lb n="30597"/>a humble carpenter for thirty years until the hour of His
<lb n="30598"/>mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He went
<lb n="30599"/>forth and called to men to hear the new gospel.</said>
<lb n="30600"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He
<lb n="30601"/>was seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a
<lb n="30602"/>fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged with
<lb n="30603"/>five thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled
<lb n="30604"/>through the streets by the jewish rabble and the Roman sol-
<lb n="30605"/>diery, stripped of His@ garments and hanged upon a gibbet and
<lb n="30606"/>His side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body
<lb n="30607"/>of Our Lord water and blood issued continually.</said>
<lb n="30608"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful
<lb n="30609"/>Redeemer had pity for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of
<lb n="30610"/>Calvary, He founded the holy catholic church against which, it
<lb n="30611"/>is promised, the gates of hell shall not prevail. He founded it
<lb n="30612"/>upon the rock of ages and endowed it with His grace, with
<lb n="30613"/>sacraments and sacrifice, and promised that if men would obey
<lb n="30614"/>the word of His church they would still enter into eternal life
<lb n="30615"/>but if, after all that had been done for them, they still persisted
<lb n="30616"/>in their wickedness there  remained for them an eternity of
<lb n="30617"/>torment: hell.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30618"/>The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for
<lb n="30619"/>an instant, parted them. Then he resumed:
<lb n="30620"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can, the
<lb n="30621"/>nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an
<lb n="30622"/>offended God has called into existence for the eternal punish-
<lb n="30623"/>ment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foulsmelling
<lb n="30624"/>prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and
<lb n="30625"/>smoke. The straitness of this prison house@ is expressly designed
<lb n="30626"/>by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws.
<lb n="30627"/>In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of
<lb n="30628"/>movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in
<lb n="30629"/>the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason
<lb n="30630"/>of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped
<lb n="30631"/>together in their awful prison@ the walls of which are said to be
<lb n="30632"/>four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly
<lb n="30633"/>bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes
<lb n="30634"/>in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove
<lb n="30635"/>from the eye a worm that gnaws it.</said>
<lb n="30636"> <said who="Father Arnall">--They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell
<lb n="30637"/>gives forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the
<lb n="30638"/>Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so, at the
<lb n="30639"/>command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity
<lb n="30640"/>of its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a neverending
<lb n="30641"/>storm of darkness, dark flames and dark smoke of burning
<lb n="30642"/>brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another
<lb n="30643"/>without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the
<lb n="30644"/>land of the Pharaohs was smitten one plague alone, that of
<lb n="30645"/>darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give
<lb n="30646"/>to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone
<lb n="30647"/>but for all eternity?</said>
<lb n="30648"> <said who="Father Arnall">--The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its
<lb n="30649"/>awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum
<lb n="30650"/>of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking
<lb n="30651"/>sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged
<lb n="30652"/>the world. The brimstone too which burns there in such pro-
<lb n="30653"/>digious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench:@ and the
<lb n="30654"/>bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential
<lb n="30655"/>odour that,@ as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would
<lb n="30656"/>suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world,
<lb n="30657"/>that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has
<lb n="30658"/>been long enclosed. Consider then what must be the foulness of
<lb n="30659"/>the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has
<lb n="30660"/>lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of
<lb n="30661"/>liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to  flames,
<lb n="30662"/>devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense
<lb n="30663"/>choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And
<lb n="30664"/>then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and
<lb n="30665"/>a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid
<lb n="30666"/>carcases@ massed together in the reeking darkness,  a huge and
<lb n="30667"/>rotting human fungus. Imagine all this and you will have some
<lb n="30668"/>idea of the horror of the stench of hell.</said>
<lb n="30669"> <said who="Father Arnall">--But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest
<lb n="30670"/>physical torment to which the damned are subjected. The
<lb n="30671"/>torment of fire is the greatest torment to which the tyrant has
<lb n="30672"/>ever subjected his fellowcreatures. Place your finger for a mo-
<lb n="30673"/>ment in the flame of a candle and you will feel the pain of fire.
<lb n="30674"/>But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit of man,
<lb n="30675"/>to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the
<lb n="30676"/>useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was
<lb n="30677"/>created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant sinner.
<lb n="30678"/>Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according
<lb n="30679"/>as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so
<lb n="30680"/>that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical
<lb n="30681"/>preparations to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphu-
<lb n="30682"/>reous brimstone which burns in hell is a substance which is
<lb n="30683"/>specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with unspeak-
<lb n="30684"/>able fury. Moreover our earthly fire destroys at the same time
<lb n="30685"/>as it burns so that the more intense it is the shorter is its dur-
<lb n="30686"/>ation: but the fire of hell has this property that it preserves that
<lb n="30687"/>which it burns and though it rages with incredible intensity it
<lb n="30688"/>rages for ever.</said>
<lb n="30689"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it
<lb n="30690"/>may be, is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell
<lb n="30691"/>is boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the
<lb n="30692"/>devil himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was
<lb n="30693"/>obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into
<lb n="30694"/>the burning ocean of hell it would be burned up in an instant
<lb n="30695"/>like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will not afflict the
<lb n="30696"/>bodies of the damned only from without but each lost soul will
<lb n="30697"/>be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals.
<lb n="30698"/>O, how terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood
<lb n="30699"/>seethes and boils in the veins, the brains are boiling in the skull,
<lb n="30700"/>the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, the bowels a
<lb n="30701"/>redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like mol-
<lb n="30702"/>ten balls.</said>
<lb n="30703"> <said who="Father Arnall">--And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and
<lb n="30704"/>boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its
<lb n="30705"/>intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument
<lb n="30706"/>chosen by divine design for the punishment of soul and body
<lb n="30707"/>alike. It is a fire which proceeds directly from the ire of God,
<lb n="30708"/>working not of its own activity but as an instrument of divine
<lb n="30709"/>vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with the
<lb n="30710"/>body so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the
<lb n="30711"/>flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of
<lb n="30712"/>the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable utter darkness,
<lb n="30713"/>the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and howls
<lb n="30714"/>and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption,
<lb n="30715"/>nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and
<lb n="30716"/>spikes, with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several
<lb n="30717"/>torments of the senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in
<lb n="30718"/>its very essence amid the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires
<lb n="30719"/>kindled in the abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent
<lb n="30720"/>God and fanned into everlasting and ever increasing fury by the
<lb n="30721"/>breath of the anger of the Godhead.</said>
<lb n="30722"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is
<lb n="30723"/>increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil com-
<lb n="30724"/>pany on earth is so noxious that even the plants, as if by
<lb n="30725"/>instinct, withdraw from the company of whatsoever is deadly
<lb n="30726"/>or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no
<lb n="30727"/>thought of family or country, of ties@ or@ relationship.@ The
<lb n="30728"/>damned howl and scream at one another, their torture and rage
<lb n="30729"/>intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like
<lb n="30730"/>themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the
<lb n="30731"/>suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The
<lb n="30732"/>mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and
<lb n="30733"/>of hatred for their fellow sufferers@ and of curses against those
<lb n="30734"/>souls which were their  accomplices in sin. In olden times it was
<lb n="30735"/>the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his
<lb n="30736"/>murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the
<lb n="30737"/>depths of the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a
<lb n="30738"/>monkey and a serpent. The intention of those lawgivers who
<lb n="30739"/>framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was to
<lb n="30740"/>punish the criminal by the company of hateful and hurtful
<lb n="30741"/>beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared
<lb n="30742"/>with the fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips
<lb n="30743"/>and aching throats of the damned in hell when they behold in
<lb n="30744"/>their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them
<lb n="30745"/>in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking
<lb n="30746"/>and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest sugges-
<lb n="30747"/>tions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured
<lb n="30748"/>them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accom-
<lb n="30749"/>plices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless
<lb n="30750"/>and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.</said>
<lb n="30751"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned
<lb n="30752"/>souls, tempters and tempted alike,  of the company of the devils.
<lb n="30753"/>These devils will afflict the damned in two ways, by their pres-
<lb n="30754"/>ence and by their reproaches. We can have no idea of how
<lb n="30755"/>horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a
<lb n="30756"/>devil and she has written that, rather than look again for one
<lb n="30757"/>single instant on such a frightful monster, she would prefer to
<lb n="30758"/>walk until the end of her life along a track of red coals. These
<lb n="30759"/>devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as hideous
<lb n="30760"/>and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and  jeer at
<lb n="30761"/>the lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the
<lb n="30762"/>foul demons, who are made in hell the voices of conscience.
<lb n="30763"/>Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to the temptings of
<lb n="30764"/>fiends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and
<lb n="30765"/>good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why
<lb n="30766"/>did you not leave that evil companion? Why did you not give
<lb n="30767"/>up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen
<lb n="30768"/>to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after
<lb n="30769"/>you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth
<lb n="30770"/>or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to
<lb n="30771"/>God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of
<lb n="30772"/>your sins? Now the time for repentance has gone by. Time is,
<lb n="30773"/>time was@ but time shall be no more! Time was to sin in secrecy,
<lb n="30774"/>to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the unlawful, to
<lb n="30775"/>yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the
<lb n="30776"/>beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field for
<lb n="30777"/>they, at least, are but brutes and have not reason to guide them:
<lb n="30778"/>time was but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so
<lb n="30779"/>many voices but you would not hear. You would not crush out
<lb n="30780"/>that pride and anger in your heart, you would not restore those
<lb n="30781"/>illgotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy
<lb n="30782"/>church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not
<lb n="30783"/>abandon those wicked companions, you would not avoid those
<lb n="30784"/>dangerous temptations. Such is the language of those fiendish
<lb n="30785"/>tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred and
<lb n="30786"/>of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when
<lb n="30787"/>they sinned sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with
<lb n="30788"/>such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they,
<lb n="30789"/>even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and dis-
<lb n="30790"/>gusted, from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by
<lb n="30791"/>which degraded man outrages and defiles the temple of the
<lb n="30792"/>Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself.</said>
<lb n="30793"> <said who="Father Arnall">--O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot
<lb n="30794"/>to hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last
<lb n="30795"/>day of terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a
<lb n="30796"/>single soul of those who are in this chapel today may be found
<lb n="30797"/>among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall
<lb n="30798"/>command to depart for ever from His sight, that not one of us
<lb n="30799"/>may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful sentence of rejec-
<lb n="30800"/>tion: <emph>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire which</emph>
<lb n="30801"/><emph>was prepared for the devil and his angels!</emph></said></p>
<p> <lb n="30802"/>He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and
<lb n="30803"/>the scalp of his head trembling as though it had been touched
<lb n="30804"/>by ghostly fingers. He passed up the staircase and into the
<lb n="30805"/>corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and water-
<lb n="30806"/>proofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping
<lb n="30807"/>and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had already
<lb n="30808"/>died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of his
<lb n="30809"/>body, that he was plunging headlong through space.</p>
<p> <lb n="30810"/>He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at
<lb n="30811"/>his desk, opening one of his books at random and poring over
<lb n="30812"/>it. Every word for him! It was true. God was almighty. God
<lb n="30813"/>could call him now, call him as he sat at his desk, before he had
<lb n="30814"/>time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him. Yes?
<lb n="30815"/>What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of
<lb n="30816"/>the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the
<lb n="30817"/>swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave
<lb n="30818"/>of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. His
<lb n="30819"/>brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and
<lb n="30820"/>bubbling within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames
<lb n="30821"/>burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices:
<lb n="30822"> <said who="Flames">--Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!</p>
<p> <lb n="30823"/>Voices spoke near him:
<lb n="30824"> <said who="a voice">--On hell.</said>
<lb n="30825"> <said who="a voice">--I suppose he rubbed it into you well.</said>
<lb n="30826"> <said who="a voice">--You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk.</said>
<lb n="30827"> <said who="a voice">--That's what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you
<lb n="30828"/>work.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30829"/>He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God
<lb n="30830"/>had spared him still. He was still in the familiar world of the
<lb n="30831"/>school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window,
<lb n="30832"/>talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their }|lb n="30833"/| heads.
<lb n="30834"/><said who="Mr Tate">--I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin on

<lb n="30836"/>must be kneedeep.</said> |lb n="30837"/|{ <said who="Vincent Heron">--It might clear up, sir.</said></p>
<lb n="30838"/>The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the
<lb n="30839"/>quiet of the classroom when the voices paused and the silence
<lb n="30840"/>was filled by the sound of softly browsing cattle as the other
<lb n="30841"/>boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul.</p>
<p> <lb n="30842"/>There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for
<lb n="30843"/>him! O Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death!</p>
<p> <lb n="30844"/>The English lesson began with the hearing of the history.
<lb n="30845"/>Royal persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops@ passed like mute
<lb n="30846"/>phantoms behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been
<lb n="30847"/>judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he
<lb n="30848"/>lost his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay
<lb n="30849"/>around him, a plain of peace whereon antlike men laboured in
<lb n="30850"/>brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet mounds. The el-
<lb n="30851"/>bow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched:
<lb n="30852"/>and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard
<lb n="30853"/>his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition.</p>
<p> <lb n="30854"/>His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no
<lb n="30855"/>longer able to suffer the pain of dread@ and sending forth, as she
<lb n="30856"/>sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would
<lb n="30857"/>repent in his heart and be forgiven:@ and then those above, those
<lb n="30858"/>in heaven, would see what he would do to make up for the
<lb n="30859"/>past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait.
<lb n="30860"> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">--All, God! All, all!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30861"/>A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were
<lb n="30862"/>being heard in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he
<lb n="30863"/>heard others passing down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew
<lb n="30864"/>round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet, listen-
<lb n="30865"/>ing and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against
<lb n="30866"/>the muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening
<lb n="30867"/>to the flutter of its ventricles.</p>
<p> <lb n="30868"/>No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he
<lb n="30869"/>had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How?
<lb n="30870"> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Father, I ...</said></p>
<lb n="30871"/>The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender
<lb n="30872"/>flesh: confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He
<lb n="30873"/>would confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely: but
<lb n="30874"/>not there among his school companions. Far away from there
<lb n="30875"/>in some dark place he would murmur out his own shame: and
<lb n="30876"/>he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did
<lb n="30877"/>not dare to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection
<lb n="30878"/>of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts
<lb n="30879"/>about him.</p>
<p> <lb n="30880"/>Time passed.</p>
<p> <lb n="30881"/>He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight
<lb n="30882"/>without was already failing and, as it fell slowly through the
<lb n="30883"/>dull red blinds, it seemed that the sun of the last day was going
<lb n="30884"/>down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgment.
<lb n="30885"> <said who="Father Arnall">--<emph>I am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes:</emph> words taken,
<lb n="30886"/>my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms,
<lb n="30887"/>thirtieth chapter, twentythird verse. In the name of the Father
<lb n="30888"/>and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="30889"/>The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His
<lb n="30890"/>face was kind and he joined gently the fingers of each hand,
<lb n="30891"/>forming a frail cage by the union of their tips.
<lb n="30892"> <said who="Father Arnall">--This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell,
<lb n="30893"/>to make what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual
<lb n="30894"/>exercises, the composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to
<lb n="30895"/>imagine with the senses of the mind, in our imagination, the
<lb n="30896"/>material character of that awful place and of the physical tor-
<lb n="30897"/>ments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall
<lb n="30898"/>consider for a few moments the nature of the spiritual torments
<lb n="30899"/>of hell.</said>
<lb n="30900"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to
<lb n="30901"/>the promptings of our corrupt nature,@ to the lower instincts, to
<lb n="30902"/>that which is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away
<lb n="30903"/>from the counsel of our higher nature, from all that is pure and
<lb n="30904"/>holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal sin is
<lb n="30905"/>punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical
<lb n="30906"/>and spiritual.</said>
<lb n="30907"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain
<lb n="30908"/>of loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater
<lb n="30909"/>than all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the
<lb n="30910"/>church, the angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst
<lb n="30911"/>damnation consists in this that the understanding of man is
<lb n="30912"/>totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately
<lb n="30913"/>turned away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a
<lb n="30914"/>being infinitely good and therefore the loss of such a being
<lb n="30915"/>must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have not a very
<lb n="30916"/>clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned in hell,
<lb n="30917"/>for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that
<lb n="30918"/>which they have lost and understand  that they have lost it
<lb n="30919"/>through their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very
<lb n="30920"/>instant of death the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and
<lb n="30921"/>the soul at once flies towards God. The soul tends towards
<lb n="30922"/>God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my
<lb n="30923"/>dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from
<lb n="30924"/>God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalien-
<lb n="30925"/>ably His. God loves with a divine love every human soul and
<lb n="30926"/>every human soul lives in that love. How could it be otherwise?
<lb n="30927"/>Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every
<lb n="30928"/>instant of life proceed from God's inexhaustible goodness. And
<lb n="30929"/>if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man
<lb n="30930"/>to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered
<lb n="30931"/>from friend, O think what pain, what anguish@ it must be for
<lb n="30932"/>the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely
<lb n="30933"/>good and loving Creator Who has called that soul into exist-
<lb n="30934"/>ence from nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with
<lb n="30935"/>an immeasurable love. This, then, to be separated for ever from
<lb n="30936"/>its greatest good, from God, and to feel the anguish of that
<lb n="30937"/>separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable, this is the
<lb n="30938"/>greatest torment which the created soul is capable of bearing,
<lb n="30939"/><seg xml:lang="la">poena damni</seg>, the pain of loss.</said>
<lb n="30940"> <said who="Father Arnall">--The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in
<lb n="30941"/>hell is the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are
<lb n="30942"/>engendered by putrefaction so in the souls of the lost there
<lb n="30943"/>arises a perpetual remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the
<lb n="30944"/>sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls
<lb n="30945"/>it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel worm
<lb n="30946"/>will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful mem-
<lb n="30947"/>ory will that be! In the lake of alldevouring flame the proud
<lb n="30948"/>king will remember the pomps of his court, the wise but wicked
<lb n="30949"/>man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover of ar-
<lb n="30950"/>tistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures,
<lb n="30951"/>he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous
<lb n="30952"/>feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines;
<lb n="30953"/>the miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his
<lb n="30954"/>illgotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and merciless mur-
<lb n="30955"/>derers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled,
<lb n="30956"/>the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures
<lb n="30957"/>in which they delighted. They will remember all this and loathe
<lb n="30958"/>themselves and their sins. For how miserable will all those
<lb n="30959"/>pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for
<lb n="30960"/>ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think that they
<lb n="30961"/>have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a few
<lb n="30962"/>pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a
<lb n="30963"/>tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the
<lb n="30964"/>second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless
<lb n="30965"/>sorrow for sins committed. Divine justice insists that the under-
<lb n="30966"/>standing of those miserable wretches be fixed continually on
<lb n="30967"/>the sins of which they were guilty and,@ moreover, as saint
<lb n="30968"/>Augustine points out, God will impart to them His own
<lb n="30969"/>knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in all its
<lb n="30970"/>hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They
<lb n="30971"/>will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will
<lb n="30972"/>be too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which
<lb n="30973"/>they neglected. This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting
<lb n="30974"/>of the worm of conscience. The conscience will say: You had
<lb n="30975"/>time and opportunity to repent and would not. You were
<lb n="30976"/>brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments
<lb n="30977"/>and graces and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had
<lb n="30978"/>the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back when
<lb n="30979"/>you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many,
<lb n="30980"/>how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No.
<lb n="30981"/>You would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you
<lb n="30982"/>turned your back on the confessional, you wallowed deeper
<lb n="30983"/>and deeper in the mire of sin. God appealed to you, threatened
<lb n="30984"/>you, entreated you to return to Him. O what shame, what
<lb n="30985"/>misery! The ruler@ of the universe entreated you, a creature
<lb n="30986"/>of clay, to love Him Who  made you and to keep His law.
<lb n="30987"/>No. You would not. And now, though you were to flood all
<lb n="30988"/>hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea of
<lb n="30989"/>repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true
<lb n="30990"/>repentance shed during your mortal life would have gained for
<lb n="30991"/>you. You implore now a moment of earthly life wherein to
<lb n="30992"/>repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.</said>
<lb n="30993"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which
<lb n="30994"/>gnaws the very heart's core of the wretches in hell so that filled
<lb n="30995"/>with hellish fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse
<lb n="30996"/>the evil companions who have brought them to such ruin and
<lb n="30997"/>curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them
<lb n="30998"/>and torture them in eternity and even revile and curse the
<lb n="30999"/>Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned and
<lb n="31000"/>slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.</said>
<lb n="31001"> <said who="Father Arnall">--The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is
<lb n="31002"/>the pain of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be
<lb n="31003"/>capable of many evils, is not capable of them all at once inas-
<lb n="31004"/>much@ as one evil corrects and counteracts  another just as one
<lb n="31005"/>poison frequently corrects another. In hell on the contrary one
<lb n="31006"/>torment, instead of counteracting another, lends it still greater
<lb n="31007"/>force: and moreover as the internal faculties are more perfect
<lb n="31008"/>than the external senses@ so are they more capable of suffering.
<lb n="31009"/>Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment so is every
<lb n="31010"/>spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive
<lb n="31011"/>faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and under-
<lb n="31012"/>standing with an interior darkness more terrible even than the
<lb n="31013"/>exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The
<lb n="31014"/>malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these demon
<lb n="31015"/>souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration, a
<lb n="31016"/>frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise
<lb n="31017"/>unless we bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God
<lb n="31018"/>bears to it.</said>
<lb n="31019"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it
<lb n="31020"/>we have the pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of all@ evils and,
<lb n="31021"/>as you know, things are more intense at their centres than at
<lb n="31022"/>their remotest points. There are no contraries or admixtures of
<lb n="31023"/>any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell. Nay,
<lb n="31024"/>things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Com-
<lb n="31025"/>pany, elsewhere a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be
<lb n="31026"/>there a continual torment: knowledge, so much longed for as
<lb n="31027"/>the chief good of the intellect, will there be hated worse than
<lb n="31028"/>ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from the lord
<lb n="31029"/>of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be
<lb n="31030"/>loathed intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very
<lb n="31031"/>long or not very great because nature either overcomes them by
<lb n="31032"/>habits or puts an end to them by sinking under their weight.
<lb n="31033"/>But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit@ for@ while
<lb n="31034"/>they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of con-
<lb n="31035"/>tinual variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another
<lb n="31036"/>and reendowing that which has enkindled it with a still fiercer
<lb n="31037"/>flame. Nor can nature escape from these intense and various
<lb n="31038"/>tortures by succumbing to them for the soul in hell@ is sustained
<lb n="31039"/>and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater.
<lb n="31040"/>Boundless extension of torment, incredible intensity of suffer-
<lb n="31041"/>ing, unceasing variety of torture &ndash;@ this is what the divine
<lb n="31042"/>majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands, this is what the
<lb n="31043"/>holiness of heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low
<lb n="31044"/>pleasures of the corrupt flesh, requires, this is what the blood
<lb n="31045"/>of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for the redemption of
<lb n="31046"/>sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon.</said>
<lb n="31047"> <said who="Father Arnall">--Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful
<lb n="31048"/>place is the eternity of hell. Eternity! O@ dread and dire word.
<lb n="31049"/>Eternity! What mind of man can understand it? And, remem-
<lb n="31050"/>ber, it is an eternity of pain. Even though the pains of hell were
<lb n="31051"/>not so terrible as they are yet they would become infinite as
<lb n="31052"/>they are destined to last for ever. But while they are everlasting
<lb n="31053"/>they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense,
<lb n="31054"/>unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for  all
<lb n="31055"/>eternity would be a dreadful torment. What must it be@ then@ to
<lb n="31056"/>bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever.@ For ever! For all
<lb n="31057"/>eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for ever. Try to
<lb n="31058"/>imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the
<lb n="31059"/>sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how
<lb n="31060"/>many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful
<lb n="31061"/>which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of
<lb n="31062"/>that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the
<lb n="31063"/>farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to re-
<lb n="31064"/>motest space, and a million miles in thickness: and imagine
<lb n="31065"/>such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multi-
<lb n="31066"/>plied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in
<lb n="31067"/>the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on
<lb n="31068"/>animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine that
<lb n="31069"/>at the end of every million years a little bird came to that
<lb n="31070"/>mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand.
<lb n="31071"/>How many millions upon millions of centuries would pass be-
<lb n="31072"/>fore that bird had carried away even a square foot of that
<lb n="31073"/>mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had
<lb n="31074"/>carried away all. Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time
<lb n="31075"/>not even one instant of eternity could be said to have ended. At
<lb n="31076"/>the end of all those billions and trillions of years eternity would
<lb n="31077"/>have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after it
<lb n="31078"/>had been all carried away and if the bird came again and
<lb n="31079"/>carried it all away again grain by grain: and if it so rose and
<lb n="31080"/>sank as many times as there are stars in the sky, atoms in the
<lb n="31081"/>air, drops of water in the sea, leaves on the trees, feathers upon
<lb n="31082"/>birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the end of all
<lb n="31083"/>those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably
<lb n="31084"/>vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to
<lb n="31085"/>have ended:@ even then, at the end of such a period, after that
<lb n="31086"/>eon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain

<lb n="31088"> <said who="Father Arnall">--A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) was
<lb n="31089"/>once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that he stood
<lb n="31090"/>in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the ticking
<lb n="31091"/>of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and it
<lb n="31092"/>seemed to this saint that the sound of the ticking was the
<lb n="31093"/>ceaseless repetition of the words: ever, never; ever, never. Ever
<lb n="31094"/>to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut off from the
<lb n="31095"/>presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; ever to be
<lb n="31096"/>eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with burning
<lb n="31097"/>spikes, never to be free from those pains; ever to have the
<lb n="31098"/>conscience upbraid one, the memory enrage, the mind filled
<lb n="31099"/>with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse and
<lb n="31100"/>revile the foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of
<lb n="31101"/>their dupes, never to behold the shining raiment of the blessed

<lb n="31111"/>which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly preys
<lb n="31112"/>upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant
<lb n="31113"/>of which is itself an eternity, and that eternity an eternity of

<lb n="31119"/>reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion of the flesh
<lb n="31120"/>and the darkness of human understanding, they are unable to
<lb n="31121"/>comprehend the hideous malice of mortal sin. They reason thus
<lb n="31122"/>because they are unable to comprehend that even venial sin is
<lb n="31123"/>of such a foul and hideous nature that even if the omnipotent
<lb n="31124"/>Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world, the
<lb n="31125"/>wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the deaths, the
<lb n="31126"/>murders, on condition that He@ allowed a single venial sin to

<lb n="31132"> <said who="Father Arnall">--A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made
<lb n="31133"/>Lucifer and a third part of the cohorts of angels fall from their

<lb n="31209"/>not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold,  that the
<lb n="31210"/>fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given power over
<lb n="31211"/>him. He waited still at the threshold  as at the entrance to some
<lb n="31212"/>dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched.
<lb n="31213"> <said who="murmuring faces">--We knew perfectly well of course that though@ it was bound
<lb n="31214"/>to come to the light he would find considerable difficulty in
<lb n="31215"/>endeavouring to try to induce himself to try to endeavour to
<lb n="31216"/>ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we knew of
<lb n="31217"/>course perfectly well&mdash;</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31218"/>Murmuring faces waited and watched;  murmurous voices
<lb n="31219"/>filled the dark shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit
<lb n="31220"/>and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the
<lb n="31221"/>room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same win-
<lb n="31222"/>dow. He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely
<lb n="31223"/>no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark.
<lb n="31224"/>He told himself that it was simply his room with the door
<lb n="31225"/>open.</p>
<p> <lb n="31226"/>He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt
<lb n="31227"/>beside it and covered his face with his hands. His hands were
<lb n="31228"/>cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest
<lb n="31229"/>and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts. Why
<lb n="31230"/>was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers?
<lb n="31231"/>To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet
<lb n="31232"/>his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and
<lb n="31233"/>circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He
<lb n="31234"/>could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of
<lb n="31235"/>soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding,
<lb n="31236"/>flesh, benumbed and weary.</p>
<p> <lb n="31237"/>That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and
<lb n="31238"/>overcloud his conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cow-
<lb n="31239"/>ardly and sincorrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to
<lb n="31240"/>forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and,
<lb n="31241"/>wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again
<lb n="31242"/>with his hands. He had  sinned. He had sinned so deeply against
<lb n="31243"/>heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called
<lb n="31244"/>God's child.</p>
<p> <lb n="31245"/>Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things?
<lb n="31246"/>His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, se-
<lb n="31247"/>cretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impeni-
<lb n="31248"/>tence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the
<lb n="31249"/>tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of
<lb n="31250"/>corruption. How came it that God had not struck him dead?
<lb n="31251"/>The leprous company of his sins closed about him, breathing
<lb n="31252"/>upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget
<lb n="31253"/>them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer  together and
<lb n="31254"/>binding down his eyelids: but the senses of the@ soul would not
<lb n="31255"/>be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places
<lb n="31256"/>where he had sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered,
<lb n="31257"/>he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear or see. He
<lb n="31258"/>desired till his frame shook under the strain of his desire and
<lb n="31259"/>until the senses of his soul closed. They closed for an instant
<lb n="31260"/>and then opened. He saw.</p>
<p> <lb n="31261"/>A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches.
<lb n="31262"/>Thick among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canis-
<lb n="31263"/>ters and clots and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight
<lb n="31264"/>struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling
<lb n="31265"/>greygreen weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the light,
<lb n="31266"/>curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the
<lb n="31267"/>stale crusted dung.</p>
<p> <lb n="31268"/>Creatures were in the field; one, three, six: creatures were
<lb n="31269"/>moving in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with
<lb n="31270"/>human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-
<lb n="31271"/>rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they
<lb n="31272"/>moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them.
<lb n="31273"/>A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces.
<lb n="31274"/>One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, an-
<lb n="31275"/>other complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the
<lb n="31276"/>tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as
<lb n="31277"/>they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding
<lb n="31278"/>hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails
<lb n="31279"/>amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling
<lb n="31280"/>closer and closer,@ to enclose, to  enclose, soft language issuing
<lb n="31281"/>from their lips, their long swishing tails  besmeared with stale
<lb n="31282"/>shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces .....</p>@
<p> <lb n="31283"/>Help!</p>
<p> <lb n="31284"/>He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and
<lb n="31285"/>neck. That was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell
<lb n="31286"/>reserved for his sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lech-
<lb n="31287"/>erous goatish fiends. For him! For him!</p>
<p> <lb n="31288"/>He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down
<lb n="31289"/>his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of
<lb n="31290"/>heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and al-
<lb n="31291"/>most fainting with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion
<lb n="31292"/>seized him within:@ and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he
<lb n="31293"/>vomited profusely in agony.</p>
<p> <lb n="31294"/>When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the win-
<lb n="31295"/>dow and, lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and
<lb n="31296"/>leaned his elbow upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and
<lb n="31297"/>amid the moving vapours from point to point of light the city
<lb n="31298"/>was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze.
<lb n="31299"/>Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to
<lb n="31300"/>breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers: and amid peace
<lb n="31301"/>and shimmering lights and quiet fragrances@ he made a covenant
<lb n="31302"/>with his heart.</p>
<p> <lb n="31303"/>He prayed:
<lb n="31304"> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">--<emph>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but</emph>
<lb n="31305"/><emph>we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a</emph>
<lb n="31306"/><emph>shrouded majesty and a bedimmed radiance for He was God.</emph>
<lb n="31307"/><emph>So He came Himself in weakness not in power and He sent</emph>
<lb n="31308"/><emph>thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature's comeliness and</emph>
<lb n="31309"/><emph>lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear</emph>
<lb n="31310"/><emph>mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty,</emph>
<lb n="31311"/><emph>dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is thy</emph>
<lb n="31312"/><emph>emblem, bright and musical, breathing purity, telling of heaven</emph>
<lb n="31313"/><emph>and infusing peace. O harbinger of day! O light of the pilgrim!</emph>
<lb n="31314"/><emph>Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across the bleak</emph>
<lb n="31315"/><emph>wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</emph></said></p>
<lb n="31316"/>His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to
<lb n="31317"/>heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.</p>
<p> <lb n="31318"/>When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch
<lb n="31319"/>of the damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed
<lb n="31320"/>behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer
<lb n="31321"/>and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the con-
<lb n="31322"/>science with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the
<lb n="31323"/>minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly
<lb n="31324"/>and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the
<lb n="31325"/>housedoor trail over the threshold  as it opened to let him in,
<lb n="31326"/>before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he
<lb n="31327"/>would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.</p>
<p> <lb n="31328"/>The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly
<lb n="31329"/>through the dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the
<lb n="31330"/>footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so
<lb n="31331"/>many cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in
<lb n="31332"/>mortal sin. Even once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an
<lb n="31333"/>instant. But how so quickly? By seeing or by thinking of seeing.
<lb n="31334"/>The eyes see the thing, without having wished first to see. Then
<lb n="31335"/>in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body under-
<lb n="31336"/>stand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field.
<lb n="31337"/>It must understand when it desires in one instant and then
<lb n="31338"/>prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels
<lb n="31339"/>and understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made
<lb n="31340"/>it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to understand
<lb n="31341"/>bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman
<lb n="31342"/>thing moved by a lower soul than his soul? His soul sickened at
<lb n="31343"/>the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender
<lb n="31344"/>marrow of his life and fattening upon the slime of lust. O why
<lb n="31345"/>was that so? O why?</p>
<p> <lb n="31346"/>He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in
<lb n="31347"/>the awe of God  Who had made all things and all men. Mad-
<lb n="31348"/>ness. Who could think such a thought? And, cowering in
<lb n="31349"/>darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his angel guardian to
<lb n="31350"/>drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to
<lb n="31351"/>his brain.</p>
<p> <lb n="31352"/>The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own
<lb n="31353"/>soul had sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through
<lb n="31354"/>his own body. Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could
<lb n="31355"/>he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must.
<lb n="31356"/>Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how
<lb n="31357"/>could he have done such things without shame? A madman, a
<lb n="31358"/>loathsome madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and
<lb n="31359"/>sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!</p>
<p> <lb n="31360"/>He walked on and on through illlit  streets, fearing to stand
<lb n="31361"/>still for a moment lest it might seem that he held back from
<lb n="31362"/>what awaited him, fearing to arrive at that towards which he
<lb n="31363"/>still turned with longing. How beautiful must be a soul in the
<lb n="31364"/>state of grace when God looked upon it with love!</p>
<p> <lb n="31365"/>Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets.
<lb n="31366"/>Their dank hair hung trailed  over their brows. They were not
<lb n="31367"/>beautiful to see as they crouched in the mire. But their souls
<lb n="31368"/>were seen by God; and if their souls were in a state of grace
<lb n="31369"/>they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.</p>
<p> <lb n="31370"/>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul
<lb n="31371"/>to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were
<lb n="31372"/>dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on
<lb n="31373"/>to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's
<lb n="31374"/>favour shone now  more and now less, stars now brighter and
<lb n="31375"/>now dimmer, sustained  and failing. And the glimmering souls
<lb n="31376"/>passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath.
<lb n="31377"/>One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went
<lb n="31378"/>out, forgotten, lost. The end: black cold void waste.</p>
<p> <lb n="31379"/>Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over
<lb n="31380"/>a vast tract of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene
<lb n="31381"/>composed itself around him; the common accents, the burning
<lb n="31382"/>gasjets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust,
<lb n="31383"/>moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross
<lb n="31384"/>the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her
<lb n="31385"/>was there a chapel near.
<lb n="30386"/><said who="an old woman">--A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel.</said>
<lb n="31387"><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Church?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31388">She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him: and,
<lb n="31389"/>as she held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe
<lb n="31390"/>of shawl, he bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by
<lb n="31391"/>her voice.
<lb n="31392"> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Thank you.</said>
<lb n="31393"/><said who="an old woman">--You are quite  welcome, sir.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31394"/>The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the
<lb n="31395"/>fragrance of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded
<lb n="31396"/>workmen with pious faces were guiding a canopy out through
<lb n="31397"/>a sidedoor, the sacristan aiding them with quiet gestures and
<lb n="31398"/>words. A few of the faithful still lingered, praying before one of
<lb n="31399"/>the sidealtars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals.
<lb n="31400"/>He approached timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body,
<lb n="31401"/>thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant shadow of the
<lb n="31402"/>church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn
<lb n="31403"/>and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus.
<lb n="31404"/>Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop
<lb n="31405"/>of a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first
<lb n="31406"/>spoken of the kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all
<lb n="31407"/>men to be meek and humble of heart.</p>
<p> <lb n="31408"/>He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be
<lb n="31409"/>meek and humble that he might be like those who knelt beside
<lb n="31410"/>him and his prayer as acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside
<lb n="31411"/>them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he dared
<lb n="31412"/>not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus,
<lb n="31413"/>in the mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the
<lb n="31414"/>carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple people  following a
<lb n="31415"/>lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending
<lb n="31416"/>their nets with patience.</p>
<p> <lb n="31417"/>A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred:
<lb n="31418"/>and, at the last moment@ glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey
<lb n="31419"/>beard and the brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered
<lb n="31420"/>the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and entered the
<lb n="31421"/>confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back
<lb n="31422"/>and the faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.</p>
<p> <lb n="31423"/>His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a
<lb n="31424"/>sinful city summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little
<lb n="31425"/>flakes of fire fell and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the
<lb n="31426"/>houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by
<lb n="31427"/>the heated air.</p>
<p> <lb n="31428"/>The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side
<lb n="31429"/>of the box. The farther slide was drawn. A woman entered
<lb n="31430"/>quietly and deftly where the first penitent had knelt. The faint
<lb n="31431"/>murmur began again.</p>
<p> <lb n="31432"/>He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one
<lb n="31433"/>foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run
<lb n="31434"/>swiftly through the dark streets. He could still escape from the
<lb n="31435"/>shame. O what shame! His face was burning with@ shame. Had
<lb n="31436"/>it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder!
<lb n="31437"/>Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful
<lb n="31438"/>thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him
<lb n="31439"/>wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually. To say it in
<lb n="31440"/>words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.</p>
<p> <lb n="31441"/>The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the far-
<lb n="31442"/>ther side of the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent
<lb n="31443"/>entered where the other penitent had come out. A soft whisper-
<lb n="31444"/>ing noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box. It was
<lb n="31445"/>the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour,
<lb n="31446"/>whispering and vanishing.</p>
<p> <lb n="31447"/>He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover
<lb n="31448"/>of the wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and
<lb n="31449"/>with God. He would love his neighbour. He would love God
<lb n="31450"/>Who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray with
<lb n="31451"/>others and be happy. God would look down on him and on
<lb n="31452"/>them and would love them all.</p>
<p> <lb n="31453"/>It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It
<lb n="31454"/>was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a
<lb n="31455"/>child, for God loved little children and suffered them to come
<lb n="31456"/>to Him. It was a terrible and a sad thing to sin. But God was
<lb n="31457"/>merciful to poor sinners who were truly sorry. How true that
<lb n="31458"/>was! That was indeed goodness.</p>
<p> <lb n="31459"/>The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He
<lb n="31460"/>was next. He stood up in terror and walked blindly into the
<lb n="31461"/>box.</p>
<p> <lb n="31462"/>At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised
<lb n="31463"/>his eyes to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could
<lb n="31464"/>see that he was sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession
<lb n="31465"/>would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then
<lb n="31466"/>what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But
<lb n="31467"/>God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was
<lb n="31468"/>sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white
<lb n="31469"/>form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his
<lb n="31470"/>trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost crea-
<lb n="31471"/>ture, praying with whimpering lips.
<lb n="31472"> <said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Sorry! Sorry! O sorry!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31473"/>The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast.
<lb n="31474"/>The face of an old priest was at the grating, averted from him,
<lb n="31475"/>leaning upon a hand. He made the sign of the cross and prayed
<lb n="31476"/>of the priest to bless him for he had sinned. Then, bowing his
<lb n="31477"/>head, he repeated the <seg xml:lang="la">Confiteor</seg> in fright. At the words <emph>my</emph>
<lb n="31478"/><emph>most grievous fault</emph> he ceased, breathless.
<lb n="31479"> <said who="Priest">--How long is it since your last confession, my child?</said>
<lb n="31480"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--A long time, father.</said>
<lb n="31481"/><said who="Priest">--A month, my child?</said>
<lb n="31482"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">Longer, father.</said>

<lb n="31486"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Eight months, father.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31487"/>He had begun. The priest asked:
<lb n="31488"/><said who="Priest">--And what do you remember since that time?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31489"/>He began to confess his sins: masses missed,  prayers not
<lb n="31490"/>said, lies.
<lb n="31491"><said who="Priest">--Anything else, my child?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31492"/>Sins of anger, envy of  others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience.

<lb n="31494"><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Sloth.</said>
<lb n="31495"><said who="Priest">--Anything else, my child?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31496"/>There was no help. He murmured:
<lb n="31497"><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I ....@ committed sins of impurity, father.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="31498"/>The priest did not turn his head.
<lb n="31499"/><said who="Priest">--With yourself, my child?</said>
<lb n="31500"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--And ... with others.</said>
<lb n="31501"/><said who="Priest">--With women, my child?</said>
<lb n="31502"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, father.</said>
<lb n="31503"/><said who="Priest">Were they married women, my child?</said></p>
<lb n="31504"/>He did not know. His sins trickled from his lips, one by one,
<lb n="31505"/>trickled in shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing
<lb n="31506"/>like a sore, a squalid stream of vice. The last sins oozed forth,
<lb n="31507"/>sluggish, filthy. There was no more to tell. He bowed his head,
<lb n="31508"/>overcome.</p>
<p> <lb n="31509"/>The priest was silent. Then he asked:
<lb n="31510"/><said who="Priest">--How old are you, my child?</said>
<lb n="31511"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Sixteen, father.</said></p>
<lb n="31512"/>The priest passed his hand several times over his face. Then,
<lb n="31513"/>resting his forehead against his hand, he leaned towards the
<lb n="31514"/>grating and, with eyes still averted, spoke slowly. His voice was
<lb n="31515"/>weary and old.
<lb n="31516"/><said who="Priest">--You are very young, my child, he said, and let me implore of
<lb n="31517"/>you to give up that sin. It is a terrible sin. It kills the body and
<lb n="31518"/>it kills the soul. It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes.
<lb n="31519"/>Give it up, my child, for God'@ sake. It is dishonourable and
<lb n="31520"/>unmanly. You cannot know where that wretched habit will
<lb n="31521"/>lead you or where it will come against you. As long as you
<lb n="31522"/>commit that sin, my poor child, you will never be worth one
<lb n="31523"/>farthing to God. Pray to our mother Mary to help you. She will
<lb n="31524"/>help you, my child. Pray to Our Blessed Lady when that sin
<lb n="31525"/>comes into  your mind. I am sure you will do that, will you not?
<lb n="31526"/>You repent of all those sins. I am sure you do. And you will
<lb n="31527"/>promise God now that by His holy grace you will never offend
<lb n="31528"/>Him any more by that wicked sin. You will make that solemn
<lb n="31529"/>promise to God, will you not?</said>
<lb n="31530"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, father.</said></p>
<lb n="31531"/>The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quak-
<lb n="31532"/>ing parching heart. How sweet and sad!
<lb n="31533"/><said who="Priest">--Do so, my poor child. The devil has  led you astray. Drive
<lb n="31534"/>him back to hell when he tempts you to dishonour your body
<lb n="31535"/>in that way - the foul spirit who hates Our Lord. Promise God
<lb n="31536"/>now that you will give up that sin, that wretched wretched sin.</said></p>
<lb n="31537"/>Blinded by his tears and by the light of God's mercifulness
<lb n="31538"/>he bent his head and heard the grave words of absolution
<lb n="31539"/>spoken and saw the priest's hand raised above him in token of
<lb n="31540"/>forgiveness.
<lb n="31541"/><said who="Priest">--God bless you, my child. Pray for me.</said></p>
<lb n="31542"/>He knelt to say his penance, praying in a corner of the dark
<lb n="31543"/>nave: and his prayers ascended to heaven from his purified
<lb n="31544"/>heart like perfume streaming upwards from a heart of white
<lb n="31545"/>rose.</p>
<p> <lb n="31546"/>The  muddy streets were gay. He strode homeward, con-
<lb n="31547"/>scious of an  invisible grace pervading and making light his
<lb n="31548"/>limbs. In spite of all he had done it. He had confessed and God
<lb n="31549"/>had pardoned him. His soul was made fair and holy once more,
<lb n="31550"/>holy and happy.</p>
<p> <lb n="31551"/>It would be beautiful to die if God so willed. It was beautiful
<lb n="31552"/>to live if God so willed, to live in grace a life of peace and
<lb n="31553"/>virtue and forbearance with others.</p>
<p> <lb n="31554"/>He sat by the fire in the kitchen, not daring to speak for
<lb n="31555"/>happiness. Till that moment he had not known how beautiful
<lb n="31556"/>and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper pinned
<lb n="31557"/>round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a
<lb n="31558"/>plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were
<lb n="31559"/>eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the
<lb n="31560"/>communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and
<lb n="31561"/>sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life
<lb n="31562"/>after all! And life lay all before him.</p>
<p> <lb n="31563"/>In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose and saw that it
<lb n="31564"/>was morning. In a waking dream he went through the quiet
<lb n="31565"/>morning towards the college.</p>
<p> <lb n="31566"/>The boys were all there, kneeling in their places. He knelt
<lb n="31567"/>among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fra-
<lb n="31568"/>grant masses of white flowers: and in the morning light the pale
<lb n="31569"/>flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and
<lb n="31570"/>silent as his own soul.</p>
<p> <lb n="31571"/>He knelt before the altar with his classmates, holding the
<lb n="31572"/>altar cloth with them over a living rail of hands. His hands
<lb n="31573"/>were trembling:@ and his soul trembled as he heard the priest
<lb n="31574"/>pass with the ciborium from communicant to communicant.
<lb n="31575"/><said who="Priest">--<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="31576"/>Could it be? He knelt there sinless and timid: and he would
<lb n="31577"/>hold upon his tongue the host and God would enter his purified
<lb n="31578"/>body.
<lb n="31579"/><said who="Priest">--<seg xml:lang="la">In vitam eternam. Amen.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="31580"/>Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It was
<lb n="31581"/>true. It was not a dream from which he would wake.  The past
<lb n="31582"/>was past.
<lb n="31583"/><said who="Priest">--<seg xml:lang="la">Corpus Domini nostri.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="31584"/>The ciborium had come to him.</p>
