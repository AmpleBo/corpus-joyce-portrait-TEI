<p> <lb n="50001"/>He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to
<lb n="50002"/>chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him,
<lb n="50003"/>staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had
<lb n="50004"/>been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought
<lb n="50005"/>back to his memory the dark turfcoloured water of the bath in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location>
<lb n="50006"/><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>. The box of pawntickets@ at his elbow had just been
<lb n="50007"/>rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers
<lb n="50008"/>the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased
<lb n="50009"/>and bearing the name of the pledger as <persName>Daly</persName> or <persName>MacEvoy</persName>.

<p> <lb n="50014"/>Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of
<lb n="50015"/>the box, speckled with lousemarks, and asked vaguely:
<lb n="50016"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--How much is the clock fast now? </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50017"/>His mother straightened the battered alarmclock that was
<lb n="50018"/>lying on its side in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece until
<lb n="50019"/>its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more
<lb n="50020"/>on its side.
<lb n="50021"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">--An hour and twentyfive minutes, she said. The right time
<lb n="50022"/>now is  twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in

<p> <lb n="50028"/>When the enamelled basin had  been fitted into the well of
<lb n="50029"/>the sink and the old washingglove flung on the side of it he
<lb n="50030"/>allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of
<lb n="50031"/>his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose.
<lb n="50032"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">--Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is

<lb n="50034"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50035"/>An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his
<lb n="50036"/>mother thrust  a damp overall into his hands, saying:
<lb n="50037"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">--Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50038"/>A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of
<lb n="50039"/>the girls to the foot of the staircase.
<p> <lb n="50040"/><said who="one of the girls">--Yes, father?</said>
<lb n="50041"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">--Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? </said>

<lb n="50045"/><said who="Simon Dedalus">--Hm!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50046"/>The girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go
<lb n="50047"/>out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said:
<lb n="50048"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--He has  a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is
<lb n="50049"/>masculine. </said>
<lb n="50050"/><said who="Mary Dedalus">--Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, <persName>Stephen</persName>, said his

<lb n="50053"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Good morning, everybody, said Stephen@ smiling and kissing
<lb n="50054"/>the tips of his fingers in adieu. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50055"/>The lane  behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went
<lb n="50056"/>down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish,
<lb n="50057"/>he heard a mad nun screeching in the <place><location><geo>53.364283 -6.244879</geo></location><placeName>nuns' madhouse</placeName></place> beyond
<lb n="50058"/>the wall:@
<lb n="50059"/><said who="???">--Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50060"/>He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his
<lb n="50061"/>head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal,
<lb n="50062"/>his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness.
<lb n="50063"/>His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an
<lb n="50064"/>unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and
<lb n="50065"/>threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their
<lb n="50066"/>echoes even out of his heart with an execration: but@ as he
<lb n="50067"/>walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling
<lb n="50068"/>about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange
<lb n="50069"/>wild smell of the wet leaves and bark@ his soul was loosed of her
<lb n="50070"/>miseries.</p>
<p> <lb n="50071"/>The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always,
<lb n="50072"/>memories of the girls and women in the plays of <persName>Gerhart
<lb n="50073"/>Hauptmann: and the memory of their pale sorrows and the
<lb n="50074"/>fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of
<lb n="50075"/>quiet joy. His morning walk across <place><location><geo>53.363150 -6.270676</geo></location><placeName>the city</placeName></place> had begun:@ and he
<lb n="50076"/>foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would
<lb n="50077"/>think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman, that as he
<lb n="50078"/>walked along <place><location><geo>53.357548 -6.242725</geo></location><placeName>the North Strand Road</placeName></place>, glancing idly at the win-
<lb n="50079"/>dows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour
<lb n="50080"/>of <persName>Guido Cavalcanti</persName> and smile, that as he went by <persName>Baird</persName>'s
<lb n="50081"/>stonecutting works in <place><location><geo>53.350416 -6.251694</geo></location><placeName>Talbot Place</placeName></place> the spirit of <persName>Ibsen</persName> would
<lb n="50082"/>blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish
<lb n="50083"/>beauty, and that passing a grimy marine dealer's@ shop beyond
<lb n="50084"/>the <placeName>Liffey</placeName> he would repeat the song by <persName>Ben Jonson</persName> which
<lb n="50085"/>begins:</p>
<p> <lb n="50086"/><l><emph>I was not wearier where I lay.</emph></l>
<p> <lb n="50087"/>His mind@ when wearied of its search for the essence of
<lb n="50088"/>beauty amid the spectral words of <persName>Aristotle</persName> or <persName>Aquinas@</persName> turned
<lb n="50089"/>often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans.
<lb n="50090"/>His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in
<lb n="50091"/>shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and
<lb n="50092"/>mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist-
<lb n="50093"/>coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of
<lb n="50094"/>chambering and false honour@ stung his monkish pride and
<lb n="50095"/>drove him on from his lurkingplace.</p>
<p> <lb n="50096"/>The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding
<lb n="50097"/>upon so that it had rapt him from the companionships of youth
<lb n="50098"/>was only a garner of slender sentences from <persName>Aristotle</persName>'s poetics
<lb n="50099"/>and psychology and a <seg xml:lang="la">Synopsis Philosophiae Scholasticae ad
<lb n="50100"/><emph>mentem divi Thomae</seg>. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and
<lb n="50101"/>selfmistrust lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but
<lb n="50102"/>lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the
<lb n="50103"/>world perished about his feet as if it had been fireconsumed:
<lb n="50104"/>and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of
<lb n="50105"/>others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of
<lb n="50106"/>beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at
<lb n="50107"/>least he had been acquainted with nobility. But@ when this brief
<lb n="50108"/>pride of silence upheld him no longer@ he was glad to find him-
<lb n="50109"/>self still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid
<lb n="50110"/>the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a
<lb n="50111"/>light heart.</p>
<p> <lb n="50112"/>Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive
<lb n="50113"/>man with the doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards
<lb n="50114"/>him down the slope of the bridge with little steps, tightly but-
<lb n="50115"/>toned into his chocolate overcoat@ and holding his furled um-
<lb n="50116"/>brella a span or two from him like a diviningrod. It must be
<lb n="50117"/>eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see the time. The
<lb n="50118"/>clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but,
<lb n="50119"/>as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him@ but
<lb n="50120"/>unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as
<lb n="50121"/>he heard it for it made him think of <persName>MacCann@</persName> and he saw him
<lb n="50122"/>a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair
<lb n="50123"/>goatee standing in the wind at <place><location><geo>53.351242 -6.260779</geo></location><placeName>Hopkins' corner</placeName></place>,@ and heard him
<lb n="50124"/>say:
<lb n="50125"/><said who="MacCann">--Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself.
<lb n="50126"/>I'm not. I'm a democrat: and I'll work and act for social liberty
<lb n="50127"/>and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of
<lb n="50128"/>the <placeName>Europe</placeName> of the future. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50129"/>Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of
<lb n="50130"/>the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the
<lb n="50131"/>headline of a placard. Thursday.  Ten to eleven;@ English:@ eleven
<lb n="50132"/>to twelve;@ French:@ twelve to one;@ physics. He fancied to himself
<lb n="50133"/>the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and
<lb n="50134"/>helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as
<lb n="50135"/>they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to
<lb n="50136"/>note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or
<lb n="50137"/>dates of birth and@ death, chief works, a favourable and an
<lb n="50138"/>unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent
<lb n="50139"/>for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked
<lb n="50140"/>around the little class of students or out of the window across
<lb n="50141"/>the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of
<lb n="50142"/>cheerless cellardamp and decay. Another head than his, right
<lb n="50143"/>before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its
<lb n="50144"/>bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without
<lb n="50145"/>humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about
<lb n="50146"/>him. Why was it that when he thought of <persName>Cranly</persName> he could
<lb n="50147"/>never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but
<lb n="50148"/>only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey
<lb n="50149"/>curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom
<lb n="50150"/>of a dream, the face of a severed head or deathmask, crowned
<lb n="50151"/>on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown.
<lb n="50152"/>It was a priestlike face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide-
<lb n="50153"/>winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the
<lb n="50154"/>jaws, priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and
<lb n="50155"/>faintly smiling: and <persName>Stephen</persName>, remembering swiftly how he had
<lb n="50156"/>told <persName>Cranly</persName> of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his
<lb n="50157"/>soul, day after day and night by night@ only to be answered by
<lb n="50158"/>his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it
<lb n="50159"/>was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those
<lb n="50160"/>whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in
<lb n="50161"/>memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.</p>
<p> <lb n="50162"/>Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark
<lb n="50163"/>cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it@ feeling
<lb n="50164"/>that it was not yet the hour  to enter it. But the nightshade of his
<lb n="50165"/>friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him
<lb n="50166"/>a tenuous and deadly exhalation:@ and he found himself
<lb n="50167"/>glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in
<lb n="50168"/>stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instan-
<lb n="50169"/>taneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind
<lb n="50170"/>like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up@ sighing with
<lb n="50171"/>age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language.
<lb n="50172"/>His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain
<lb n="50173"/>and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band
<lb n="50174"/>and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:</p>
<lg>
<lb n="50175"/><l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l>
<lb n="50176"/><l>And whines and twines upon the wall</l>
<lb n="50177"/><l>The ivy whines upon the wall</l>
<lb n="50178"/><l>The yellow ivy on the wall</l>
<lb n="50179"/><l>Ivy, ivy up the wall.</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="50180"/>Did any one ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever
<lb n="50181"/>heard of ivy whining on a wall? Yellow ivy: that was all right.
<lb n="50182"/>Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?</p>
<p> <lb n="50183"/>The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than
<lb n="50184"/>any ivory sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. <emph>Ivory,
<lb n="50185"/><emph>ivoire</emph>, <seg xml:lang="ita">avorio</seg>, <seg xml:lang="la">ebur</seg>.</emph> One of the first examples that he had
<lb n="50186"/>learnt in Latin had run: <seg xml:lang="la">India mittit ebur</seg>; and he recalled the
<lb n="50187"/>shrewd northern face of the rector who had taught him to
<lb n="50188"/>construe the Metamorphoses of <persName>Ovid</persName> in a courtly English,
<lb n="50189"/>made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and
<lb n="50190"/>chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws
<lb n="50191"/>of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese
<lb n="50192"/>priest:</p>
<p> <lb n="50193"/><l><seg xml:lang="la">Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates.</seg></l>
<p> <lb n="50194"/>The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history
<lb n="50195"/>were handed on to him in the trite words <seg xml:lang="la">in tanto discrimine</seg>
<lb n="50196"/>and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities
<lb n="50197"/>through the words <seg xml:lang="la">implere ollam denariorum</seg> which the rector
<lb n="50198"/>had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries.
<lb n="50199"/>The pages of his timeworn <persName>Horace</persName> never felt cold to the touch
<lb n="50200"/>even when his own fingers were cold:  they were human pages:
<lb n="50201"/>and fifty years before they had been turned by the human
<lb n="50202"/>fingers of <persName>John Duncan Inverarity</persName> and by his brother@ <persName>William
<lb n="50203"/>Malcolm Inverarity</persName>. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky
<lb n="50204"/>flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses
<lb n="50205"/>were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in
<lb n="50206"/>myrtle and lavender and vervain:@ but yet it wounded him to
<lb n="50207"/>think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the
<lb n="50208"/>world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of
<lb n="50209"/>which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was
<lb n="50210"/>held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and
<lb n="50211"/>curious jargons of heraldry and falconry.</p>
<p> <lb n="50212"/>The grey block <place><location><geo>53.345478 -6.257690</geo></location><placeName>of Trinity</placeName></place> on his left, set heavily in the city's
<lb n="50213"/>ignorance like a great dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled
<lb n="50214"/>his mind downward:@ and while he was striving this way and
<lb n="50215"/>that to free his feet from the fetters of the reformed conscience
<lb n="50216"/>he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.</p>
<p> <lb n="50217"/>He looked at it without anger: for, though sloth of the body
<lb n="50218"/>and of  the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the
<lb n="50219"/>shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the
<lb n="50220"/>servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It
<lb n="50221"/>was a <persName>Firbolg</persName> in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he
<lb n="50222"/>thought of his friend <persName>Davin</persName>, the peasant student. It was a
<lb n="50223"/>jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with it
<lb n="50224"/>lightly, saying:
<lb n="50225"/><said who="Davin">--Go on, Stevie.@ I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what
<lb n="50226"/>you will. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50227"/>The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his
<lb n="50228"/>friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he
<lb n="50229"/>was as formal in speech with others as they were with him.
<lb n="50230"/>Often, as he sat in <persName>Davin</persName>'s rooms in <place><location><geo>53.334106 -6.266592</geo></location><placeName>Grantham Street</placeName></place>, wonder-
<lb n="50231"/>ing at his friend's wellmade boots that flanked the wall pair by
<lb n="50232"/>pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and
<lb n="50233"/>cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and
<lb n="50234"/>dejection, the rude <persName>Firbolg</persName> mind of his listener had drawn his
<lb n="50235"/>mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet
<lb n="50236"/>inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English
<lb n="50237"/>speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill -@ (for@
<lb n="50238"/>Davin had sat at the feet of <persName>Michael Cusack</persName>, the Gael),@
<lb n="50239"/>repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or
<lb n="50240"/>by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes@
<lb n="50241"/>the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew
<lb n="50242"/>was still a nightly fear.</p>
<p> <lb n="50243"/>Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his
<lb n="50244"/>uncle <persName>Mat Davin</persName>, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped
<lb n="50245"/>the sorrowful legend of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The gossip of his fellowstu-
<lb n="50246"/>dents which strove to render the flat life of the college signifi-
<lb n="50247"/>cant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His
<lb n="50248"/>nurse had taught him Irish and shaped the@ rude imagination by
<lb n="50249"/>the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards this myth
<lb n="50250"/>upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of
<lb n="50251"/>beauty and to its unwieldy  tales that divided against@ themselves
<lb n="50252"/>as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards
<lb n="50253"/>the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal
<lb n="50254"/>serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from
<lb n="50255"/>England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed
<lb n="50256"/>against in obedience to a password: and of the world that lay
<lb n="50257"/>beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of <place><location><geo>46.227638 2.213749</geo></location><placeName>France</placeName></place> in
<lb n="50258"/>which he spoke of serving.</p>
<p> <lb n="50259"/>Coupling this ambition with the young man's diffident hu-
<lb n="50260"/>mour <persName>Stephen</persName> had often called him one of the tame geese: and
<lb n="50261"/>there was even a point of irritation in the name pointed against
<lb n="50262"/>that very reluctance of speech and deed in his friend which
<lb n="50263"/>seemed so often to stand between <persName>Stephen</persName>'s mind, eager of
<lb n="50264"/>speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life.</p>
<p> <lb n="50265"/>One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent
<lb n="50266"/>or luxurious language in which <persName>Stephen</persName> escaped from the cold
<lb n="50267"/>silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before <persName>Stephen</persName>'s
<lb n="50268"/>mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards
<lb n="50269"/>Davin's rooms@ through the dark narrow streets of the poorer
<lb n="50270"/>jews.
<lb n="50271"/><said who="Davin">--A thing happened to myself, <persName>Stevie</persName>, last autumn@ coming on
<lb n="50272"/>winter and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first
<lb n="50273"/>person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or
<lb n="50274"/>November. It was October because it was before  I came up
<lb n="50275"/>here to join the matriculation class. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50276"/><persName>Stephen</persName> had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's

<lb n="50281"/>match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles
<lb n="50282"/>and by God, <persName>Stevie</persName>, that was the hard fight. My first cousin@
<lb n="50283"/>Fonsy Davin@ was stripped to his buff that day minding cool for
<lb n="50284"/>the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the time

<lb n="50293"/>was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and
<lb n="50294"/>I couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck
<lb n="50295"/>would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in
<lb n="50296"/><placeName>Castletownroche</placeName>and all the cars in the country were there. So
<lb n="50297"/>there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out.
<lb n="50298"/>Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on
<lb n="50299"/>night when I got into the  <place><location><geo>52.303056 -8.538611</geo></location><placeName>Ballyhoura hills@</placeName></place> that's better than ten
<lb n="50300"/>miles from <place><location><geo>52.399821 -8.575387</geo></location><placeName>Kilmallock</placeName></place> and there's a long lonely road after that.
<lb n="50301"/>You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or
<lb n="50302"/>hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped
<lb n="50303"/>by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the
<lb n="50304"/>dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last@
<lb n="50305"/>after a bend of the road@ I spied a little cottage with a light in
<lb n="50306"/>the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked
<lb n="50307"/>who was there and I answered I was over at the match in
<lb n="50308"/><placeName>Buttevant</placeName> and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a
<lb n="50309"/>glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door
<lb n="50310"/>and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed
<lb n="50311"/>as if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair
<lb n="50312"/>hanging: and I thought by her figure and by something in the
<lb n="50313"/>look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me
<lb n="50314"/>in talk a long while at the door and I thought it strange because
<lb n="50315"/>her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I
<lb n="50316"/>tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was
<lb n="50317"/>all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that
<lb n="50318"/>morning to <place><location><geo>53.273188 -6.092767</geo></location><placeName>Queenstown</placeName></place> with his sister to see her off. And all
<lb n="50319"/>the time she was talking, <persName>Stevie</persName>, she had her eyes fixed on my
<lb n="50320"/>face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing.
<lb n="50321"/>When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to
<lb n="50322"/>draw me in over the threshold and said: <emph>Come in and stay the
<lb n="50323"/><emph>night here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no-one@ in it
<lb n="50324"/><emph>but ourselves</emph> ........@ I didn't go in, <persName>Stevie</persName>.  I thanked her and
<lb n="50325"/>went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the
<lb n="50326"/>road I looked back and she was standing in@ the door. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50327"/>The last words of <persName>Davin</persName>'s story sang in his memory  and the
<lb n="50328"/>figure of the woman in the story stood forth@ reflected in other
<lb n="50329"/>figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in
<lb n="50330"/>the doorways at <place><location><geo>53.293785 -6.687040</geo></location><placeName>Clane</placeName></place> as the college cars drove by, as a type of
<lb n="50331"/>her race and his own, a batlike soul waking to the conscious-
<lb n="50332"/>ness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and,
<lb n="50333"/>through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without
<lb n="50334"/>guile, calling the stranger to her bed.</p>
<p> <lb n="50335"/>A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried:
<lb n="50336"/><said who="???">--Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today,
<lb n="50337"/>gentleman. Buy  that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50338"/>The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her
<lb n="50339"/>young blue eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guile-
<lb n="50340"/>lessness: and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw
<lb n="50341"/>only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and  hoydenish
<lb n="50342"/>face.>
<lb n="50343"/><said who="???">--Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir!</said>
<lb n="50344"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I have no money, said Stephen. </said>
<lb n="50345"/><said who="???">--Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny.</said>
<lb n="50346"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards
<lb n="50347"/>her. I told you I had no money. I tell you again now.</said>
<lb n="50348"/><said who="???">--Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl
<lb n="50349"/>answered after an instant.</said>
<lb n="50350"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. </said></p>
<p> <lb n="50351"/>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to
<lb n="50352"/>gibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her
<lb n="50353"/>ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. <place><location><geo>53.342300 -6.259747</geo></location><placeName>
<lb n="50354"/>Grafton Street</placeName></place>,@ along which he walked@ prolonged that moment
<lb n="50355"/>of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street
<lb n="50356"/>a slab was set to the memory of <persName>Wolfe Tone</persName> and he remem-
<lb n="50357"/>bered having been present with his father at its laying. He re-
<lb n="50358"/>membered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There
<lb n="50359"/>were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling
<lb n="50360"/>young man, held, wedged on a stick,  a card on which were
<lb n="50361"/>printed the words: <seg xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Irlande!</seg></p>
<p> <lb n="50362"/>But the trees in <place><location><geo>53.338174 -6.259119</geo></location><placeName>Stephen's Green</placeName></place> were fragrant of rain and
<lb n="50363"/>the rainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint in-
<lb n="50364"/>cense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The
<lb n="50365"/>soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of
<lb n="50366"/>had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from the
<lb n="50367"/>earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the
<lb n="50368"/>sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other
<lb n="50369"/>than that of <persName>Buck Egan</persName> and <persName>Burnchapel Whaley</persName>.</p>
<p> <lb n="50370"/>It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed
<lb n="50371"/>the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the
<lb n="50372"/>physics theatre. The corridor was dark and silent but not un-
<lb n="50373"/>watchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it
<lb n="50374"/>because he had heard that in <persName>Buck Whaley</persName>'s time there was a
<lb n="50375"/>secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extraterritorial
<lb n="50376"/>and was he walking among aliens? The <placeName>Ireland</placeName>of <persName>Tone</persName> and of
<lb n="50377"/><persName>Parnell</persName> seemed to have receded in space.</p>
<p> <lb n="50378"/>He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly
<lb n="50379"/>grey light that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure
<lb n="50380"/>was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and
<lb n="50381"/>greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the
<lb n="50382"/>fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fire-
<lb n="50383"/>place.
<lb n="50384"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Good morning, sir! Can I help you?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50385"/>The priest looked up quickly and said:
<lb n="50386"/><said who="???">--One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is
<lb n="50387"/>an art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have
<lb n="50388"/>the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts.</said>
<lb n="50389"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I will try to learn it, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50390"/><said who="???">--Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his
<lb n="50391"/>task, that is one of the secrets.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50392"/>He produced four candle butts@ from the sidepockets of his
<lb n="50393"/>soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted
<lb n="50394"/>papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the
<lb n="50395"/>flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of
<lb n="50396"/>his wisps of paper and candle butts@ he seemed more than ever a
<lb n="50397"/>humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty
<lb n="50398"/>temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen
<lb n="50399"/>the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one
<lb n="50400"/>whom the canonicals or the  bellbordered ephod would irk and
<lb n="50401"/>trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the
<lb n="50402"/>Lord &ndash; in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings se-
<lb n="50403"/>cretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when
<lb n="50404"/>bidden &ndash; and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or
<lb n="50405"/>of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that
<lb n="50406"/>service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading
<lb n="50407"/>abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity &ndash;@ a mortified will no more
<lb n="50408"/>responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of
<lb n="50409"/>love or combat his aging body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a
<lb n="50410"/>silverpointed down.</p>
<p> <lb n="50411"/>The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks
<lb n="50412"/>catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said:
<lb n="50413"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I am sure I could not light a fire.</said>
<lb n="50414"/><said who="???">--You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean,
<lb n="50415"/>glancing up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist
<lb n="50416"/>is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another
<lb n="50417"/>question.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50418"/>He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.
<lb n="50419"/><said who="???">--Can you solve that question now? he asked.</sai>
<lb n="50420"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa
<lb n="50421"/>placent</seg>.</said>
<lb n="50422"/><said who="???">--This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye.
<lb n="50423"/>Will it therefore be beautiful?</said>
<lb n="50424"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose
<lb n="50425"/>means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aqui-
<lb n="50426"/>nas also says <seg xml:lang="la">Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</seg>. In so far as it
<lb n="50427"/>satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell
<lb n="50428"/>however it is an evil.</said>
<lb n="50429"/><said who="???">--Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the
<lb n="50430"/>head.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50431"/>He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and
<lb n="50432"/>said:
<lb n="50433"/><said who="???">--A draught is said to be a help in these matters.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50434"/>As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a
<lb n="50435"/>brisk step, Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at
<lb n="50436"/>him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but
<lb n="50437"/>in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius' enthusiasm. Even the
<lb n="50438"/>legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret
<lb n="50439"/>than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his
<lb n="50440"/>soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the
<lb n="50441"/>shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for
<lb n="50442"/>the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or
<lb n="50443"/>hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a
<lb n="50444"/>firm gesture of obedience, back upon themselves: and for all
<lb n="50445"/>this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master
<lb n="50446"/>and little, if at all, the ends he served. <seg xml:lang="la">Similiter atque senis
<lb n="50447"/>baculus</seg>, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a
<lb n="50448"/>staff in an old man's hand, to be left in a corner, to be leaned
<lb n="50449"/>on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,  to lie with a
<lb n="50450"/>lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.</p>
<p> <lb n="50451"/>The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his
<lb n="50452"/>chin.
<lb n="50453"/><said who="???">--When may we expect to have something from you on the
<lb n="50454"/>esthetic question? he asked.</said>
<lb n="50455"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on  an idea
<lb n="50456"/>once a fortnight if I am lucky.</said>
<lb n="50457"/><said who="???">--These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the
<lb n="50458"/>dean. It is like looking down from the <place><location><geo>53.545240 -7.943510</geo></location><placeName>cliffs of Moher</placeName></place> into the
<lb n="50459"/>depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up.
<lb n="50460"/>Only the trained diver can go down into those depths and
<lb n="50461"/>explore them and come to the surface again.</said>
<lb n="50462"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure
<lb n="50463"/>that there is no such thing  as free thinking inasmuch as all
<lb n="50464"/>thinking must be bound by its own laws.</said>
<lb n="50465"/><said who="???">--Ha!</said>
<lb n="50466"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one
<lb n="50467"/>or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas.</said>
<lb n="50468"/><said who="???">--I see. I quite see your point.</said>
<lb n="50469"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have
<lb n="50470"/>done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or
<lb n="50471"/>smells I shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I
<lb n="50472"/>shall sell it and buy or borrow@ another.</said>
<lb n="50473"/><said who="???">--Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for
<lb n="50474"/>a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his
<lb n="50475"/>philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus?</said>
<lb n="50476"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the
<lb n="50477"/>soul is very like a bucketful of water.</said>
<lb n="50478"/><said who="???">--He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put
<lb n="50479"/>an iron lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief
<lb n="50480"/>stole the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that
<lb n="50481"/>it was in the character of a thief to steal and determined to buy
<lb n="50482"/>an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50483"/>A smell  of molten  tallow came up from the dean's candle@
<lb n="50484"/>butts and fused itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle
<lb n="50485"/>of the words, bucket and lamp and lamp and bucket. The
<lb n="50486"/>priest's voice too had a hard jingling tone. Stephen's mind
<lb n="50487"/>halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and the  imagery
<lb n="50488"/>and by the priest's face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a
<lb n="50489"/>reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it?
<lb n="50490"/>A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud,
<lb n="50491"/>charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God?
<lb n="50492"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50493"/><said who="???">--Undoubtedly, said the dean.</said>
<lb n="50494"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to
<lb n="50495"/>know whether words are being used according to the literary
<lb n="50496"/>tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I
<lb n="50497"/>remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the
<lb n="50498"/>Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the full company of the
<lb n="50499"/>saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite differ-
<lb n="50500"/>ent. <emph>I hope I am not detaining you.</emph></said>
<lb n="50501"/><said who="???">--Not in the least, said the dean politely.</said>
<lb n="50502"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--No, no, said Stephen@ smiling, I mean ....</said>@
<lb n="50503"/><said who="???">--Yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point:
<lb n="50504"/><emph>detain</emph>.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50505"/>He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short
<lb n="50506"/>cough.
<lb n="50507"/><said who="???">--To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice
<lb n="50508"/>problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful
<lb n="50509"/>when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more
<lb n="50510"/>than the funnel can hold.</said>
<lb n="50511"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--What funnel? asked Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50512"/><said who="???">--The funnel through which you pour the  oil into your lamp.</said>
<lb n="50513"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tun-
<lb n="50514"/>dish?</said>
<lb n="50515"/><said who="???">--What is a tundish?</said>
<lb n="50516"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That. The ... the funnel.</said>
<lb n="50517"/><said who="???">--Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never
<lb n="50518"/>heard the word in my life.</said>
<lb n="50519"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--It is called a tundish in <place><location><geo>53.364757 -6.256734</geo></location><placeName>Lower Drumcondra</placeName></place>, said Stephen
<lb n="50520"/>laughing, where they speak the best English.</said>
<lb n="50521"/><said who="???">--A tundish!@ said the dean reflectively. That is a most interest-
<lb n="50522"/>ing word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50523"/>His courtesy of manner rang a little false@ and Stephen looked
<lb n="50524"/>at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in
<lb n="50525"/>the parable may have turned on the prodigal. A humble fol-
<lb n="50526"/>lower in the wake of clamorous conversions,  a poor English-
<lb n="50527"/>man in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit
<lb n="50528"/>history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and
<lb n="50529"/>envy and struggle and indignity had been all but given through
<lb n="50530"/>&ndash; a latecomer,@ a tardy spirit.  From what had he set out? Per-
<lb n="50531"/>haps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters,
<lb n="50532"/>seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of
<lb n="50533"/>the establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith
<lb n="50534"/>amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent
<lb n="50535"/>schisms, six principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake
<lb n="50536"/>baptists, supralapsarian dogmatists? Had he found the true
<lb n="50537"/>church all of a sudden in winding up to the end like a reel of
<lb n="50538"/>cotton some finespun line of reasoning upon insufflation or the
<lb n="50539"/>imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy Ghost? Or
<lb n="50540"/>had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that
<lb n="50541"/>disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the
<lb n="50542"/>door of some zincroofed chapel, yawning and telling over his
<lb n="50543"/>church pence?</p>
<p> <lb n="50544"/>The dean repeated the word yet again.
<lb n="50545"/><said who="???">--Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!</said>
<lb n="50546"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more
<lb n="50547"/>interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to
<lb n="50548"/>express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50549"/>The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his
<lb n="50550"/>sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt
<lb n="50551"/>with a smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speak-
<lb n="50552"/>ing was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:
<lb n="50553"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The language in which we are speaking is his before it is
<lb n="50554"/>mine. How different are the words <emph>home, Christ, ale, master</emph>@ on
<lb n="50555"/>his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words with-
<lb n="50556"/>out unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign,
<lb n="50557"/>will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or
<lb n="50558"/>accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets
<lb n="50559"/>in the shadow of his language.</said>
<lb n="50560"/><said who="???">--And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime,
<lb n="50561"/>the dean added. To distinguish between moral beauty and ma-
<lb n="50562"/>terial beauty. And to inquire what kind of  beauty is proper to
<lb n="50563"/>each of the various arts. These are some interesting points we
<lb n="50564"/>might take up.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50565"/>Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm dry tone,
<lb n="50566"/>was silent. The dean also was silent: and through the silence a
<lb n="50567"/>distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the
<lb n="50568"/>staircase.
<lb n="50569"/><said who="???">--In pursuing  these speculations, said the dean conclusively,
<lb n="50570"/>there is however the danger of perishing of inanition. First you
<lb n="50571"/>must take your degree. Set that before you as your first aim.
<lb n="50572"/>Then, little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every
<lb n="50573"/>sense, your way in life and in thinking. It may be uphill pedal-
<lb n="50574"/>ling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a long time before he
<lb n="50575"/>got to the top. But he got there.</said>
<lb n="50576"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly.</said>
<lb n="50577"/><said who="???">--You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say
<lb n="50578"/>what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. <seg xml:lang="la">Per
<lb n="50579"/><emph>aspera ad astra.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50580"/>He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to
<lb n="50581"/>oversee the arrival of the first arts' class.</p>
<p> <lb n="50582"/>Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly
<lb n="50583"/>and impartially every student of the class and could almost see
<lb n="50584"/>the frank smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity be-
<lb n="50585"/>gan to fall like a dew upon his easily embittered heart for this
<lb n="50586"/>faithful servingman of the knightly Loyola, for this halfbrother
<lb n="50587"/>of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of
<lb n="50588"/>soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly fa-
<lb n="50589"/>ther: and he thought how this man and his companions had
<lb n="50590"/>earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the un-
<lb n="50591"/>worldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during
<lb n="50592"/>all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the
<lb n="50593"/>lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.</p>
<p> <lb n="50594"/>The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of <place><location><geo>51.278708 0.521725</geo></location>
<lb n="50595"/><placeName>Kentish</placeName></place> fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on
<lb n="50596"/>the highest tier of the gloomy theatre under the grey cob-
<lb n="50597"/>webbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the re-
<lb n="50598"/>sponses to the names were given out in all tones until the name
<lb n="50599"/>of Peter Byrne was reached.
<lb n="50600"/><said who="???">--Here!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50601"/>A deep bass@ note in response came from the upper tier,
<lb n="50602"/>followed by coughs of protest along the other benches.</p>
<p> <lb n="50603"/>The professor paused in his reading and called the next
<lb n="50604"/>name:
<lb n="50605"/><said who="???">--Cranly!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50606"/>No answer.
<lb n="50607"/><said who="???">--Mr Cranly!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50608"/>A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his
<lb n="50609"/>friend's studies.
<lb n="50610"/><said who="???">--Try <place><location><geo>53.267776 -6.198408</geo></location><placeName>Leopardstown</placeName></place>! said a voice from the bench behind.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50611"/>Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face@
<lb n="50612"/>outlined on the grey light@ was impassive. A formula was given
<lb n="50613"/>out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back
<lb n="50614"/>again and said:
<lb n="50615"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Give me some paper for God'@ sake.</said>
<lb n="50616"/><said who="???">--Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50617"/>He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whis-
<lb n="50618"/>pering:
<lb n="50619"/><said who="???">--In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50620"/>The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of
<lb n="50621"/>paper, the coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor,
<lb n="50622"/>the spectrelike symbols of force and velocity fascinated and
<lb n="50623"/>jaded Stephen's mind. He had heard some say that the old
<lb n="50624"/>professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It
<lb n="50625"/>seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness through
<lb n="50626"/>which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long
<lb n="50627"/>slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler
<lb n="50628"/>twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe
<lb n="50629"/>ever vaster, farther and more impalpable.
<lb n="50630"/><said who="???">--So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal.
<lb n="50631"/>Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works
<lb n="50632"/>of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the
<lb n="50633"/>billiard sharp who is condemned to play:
<lg type="song">
<lb n="50634"/><l>On a cloth untrue</l>
<lb n="50635"/><l>With a twisted cue</l>
<lb n="50636"/><l>And elliptical billiard balls.</l>
</lg>
<lb n="50637"/>He@ means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the princi-
<lb n="50638"/>pal axes of which I spoke a moment ago.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50639"/>Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and mur-
<lb n="50640"/>mured:
<lb n="50641"/><said who="???">--What price ellipsoidal balls! Chase me, ladies, I'm in the
<lb n="50642"/>cavalry!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50643"/>His fellowstudent's rude humour ran like a gust through the
<lb n="50644"/>cloister of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly
<lb n="50645"/>vestments that hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and
<lb n="50646"/>caper in a sabbath of misrule. The forms of the community
<lb n="50647"/>emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of studies,
<lb n="50648"/>the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president,
<lb n="50649"/>the little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the
<lb n="50650"/>squat peasant form of the professor of economics, the tall form
<lb n="50651"/>of the young professor of mental science discussing on the
<lb n="50652"/>landing a case of conscience with his class like a giraffe crop-
<lb n="50653"/>ping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled
<lb n="50654"/>prefect of the sodality, the plump roundheaded professor of
<lb n="50655"/>Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stum-
<lb n="50656"/>bling, tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog,
<lb n="50657"/>holding one another back, shaken with deep false@ laughter,
<lb n="50658"/>smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude mal-
<lb n="50659"/>ice, calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting
<lb n="50660"/>with sudden dignity at some rough usage, whispering two and
<lb n="50661"/>two behind their hands.</p>
<p> <lb n="50662"/>The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall
<lb n="50663"/>from a shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away
<lb n="50664"/>the dust from many points and, bearing it carefully to the table,
<lb n="50665"/>held a finger on it while he proceeded with his lecture. He
<lb n="50666"/>explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound
<lb n="50667"/>called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino.</p>
<p> <lb n="50668"/>He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer.
<lb n="50669"/>Moynihan whispered from behind:
<lb n="50670"/><said who="???">--Good old Fresh Water Martin!</said>
<lb n="50671"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he
<lb n="50672"/>wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50673"/>Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in
<lb n="50674"/>his bench and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand,
<lb n="50675"/>began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin:
<lb n="50676"/><said who="???">--Please, teacher! Please, teacher! This boy is after saying a
<lb n="50677"/>bad word, teacher.</said>
<lb n="50678"/><said who="???">--Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to Ger-
<lb n="50679"/>man silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance
<lb n="50680"/>variation by changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is in-
<lb n="50681"/>sulated and the covering of silk that insulates it is wound
<lb n="50682"/>double on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger is. If it
<lb n="50683"/>were wound single an extra current would be induced in the
<lb n="50684"/>coils. The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffinwax@ ...</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50685"/>A sharp <place><location><geo>54.407332 -7.024250</geo></location><placeName>Ulster</placeName></place> voice said from the bench below Stephen:
<lb n="50686"/><said who="???">--Are we  likely to be asked questions on applied science?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50687"/>The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure
<lb n="50688"/>science and applied science. A heavybuilt student wearing gold
<lb n="50689"/>spectacles stared with some wonder at the questioner. Moyni-
<lb n="50690"/>han murmured from behind in his natural voice:
<lb n="50691"/><said who="???">--Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50692"/>Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull beneath
<lb n="50693"/>him overgrown with tangled twinecoloured hair. The voice, the
<lb n="50694"/>accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed
<lb n="50695"/>the offence to carry  him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his
<lb n="50696"/>mind think that the student's father would have done better
<lb n="50697"/>had he sent his son to <place><location><geo>54.597285 -5.930120</geo></location><placeName>Belfast</placeName></place> to study and have saved some-
<lb n="50698"/>thing on the trainfare@ by so doing.</p>
<p> <lb n="50699"/>The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of
<lb n="50700"/>thought and yet the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he
<lb n="50701"/>saw in a moment the student's wheypale face.
<lb n="50702"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came
<lb n="50703"/>from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can
<lb n="50704"/>you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race was
<lb n="50705"/>bartered and its elect betrayed &ndash;@ by the questioner or  by the
<lb n="50706"/>mocker? Patience. Remember Epictetus. It is probably in his
<lb n="50707"/>character to ask such a question at such a moment in such a
<lb n="50708"/>tone and to pronounce the word <emph>science</emph> as a monosyllable.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50709"/>The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself
<lb n="50710"/>slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling,
<lb n="50711"/>trebling, quadrupling its somnolent energy as the coil multi-
<lb n="50712"/>plied its ohms of resistance.</p>
<p> <lb n="50713"/>Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant
<lb n="50714"/>bell:
<lb n="50715"/><said who="???">--Closing time, gents!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50716"/>The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a
<lb n="50717"/>table near the door were two photographs in frames and be-
<lb n="50718"/>tween them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of
<lb n="50719"/>signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the stu-
<lb n="50720"/>dents, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after
<lb n="50721"/>another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood
<lb n="50722"/>talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nod-
<lb n="50723"/>ding his head.</p>
<p> <lb n="50724"/>Stephen,  checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresol-
<lb n="50725"/>utely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's
<lb n="50726"/>dark eyes were watching him.
<lb n="50727"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Have you signed? Stephen asked.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50728"/>Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth, communed with
<lb n="50729"/>himself an instant and answered:
<lb n="50730"/><said who="Cranly">--<seg xml:lang="la">Ego habeo.</seg></said>
<lb n="50731"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--What is it for?</said>
<lb n="50732"/><said who="Cranly">--<seg xml:lang="la">Quod?</seg></said>
<lb n="50734"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus"> --What is it for?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50734"/>Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and
<lb n="50735"/>bitterly:
<lb n="50736"/><said who="Cranly">--<seg xml:lang="la">Per pax universalis.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50737"/>Stephen pointed to the Czar's@ photograph and said:
<lb n="50738"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--He has the face of a besotted Christ.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50739"/>The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back
<lb n="50740"/>from a calm survey of the walls of the hall.
<lb n="50741"/><said who="Cranly">--Are you annoyed? he asked.</p>
<lb n="50742"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--No, answered Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50743"/><said who="Cranly">--Are you in bad humour?</said>
<lb n="50744"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--No.</said>
<p> <lb n="50745"/><said who="Cranly">--<seg xml:lang="la">Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</seg>, said Cranly, <seg xml:lang="la">quia
<lb n="50746"/><emph>facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50747"/>Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear:
<lb n="50748"/><said who="Moynihan">--MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop.
<lb n="50749"/>Brandnew world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50750"/>Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when
<lb n="50751"/>Moynihan had passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes.
<lb n="50752"/><said who="???">--Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so
<lb n="50753"/>freely into my ear. Can you?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50754"/>A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at
<lb n="50755"/>the table where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the
<lb n="50756"/>roll, and then said flatly:
<lb n="50757"/><said who="???">--A sugar!</said>
<lb n="50758"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">">--<seg xml:lang="la">Quis est in malo humore</seg>, said Stephen, <seg xml:lang="la">ego aut vos?</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50759"/>Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his
<lb n="50760"/>judgment and repeated with the same flat force:
<lb n="50761"/><said who="???">--A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50762"/>It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen won-
<lb n="50763"/>dered whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over
<lb n="50764"/>his memory. The heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of
<lb n="50765"/>hearing like a stone through a quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as
<lb n="50766"/>he had seen many an other,@ feeling its heaviness depress his
<lb n="50767"/>heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare
<lb n="50768"/>phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned versions of
<lb n="50769"/>Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin
<lb n="50770"/>given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of
<lb n="50771"/>the sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a <place><location><geo>52.979861 -6.048263</geo></location><placeName>Wicklow</placeName></place>
<lb n="50772"/>pulpit.</p>
<p> <lb n="50773"/>The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann
<lb n="50774"/>marched briskly towards them from the other side of the hall.
<lb n="50775"/><said who="???">--Here you are! said MacCann cheerily.</said>
<lb n="50776"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Here I am! said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50777"/><said who="???">--Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive tendency
<lb n="50778"/>with a respect for punctuality?</said>
<lb n="50779"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50780"/>His smiling eyes were fixed on a silverwrapped tablet of milk
<lb n="50781"/>chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breastpocket.
<lb n="50782"/>A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A
<lb n="50783"/>lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face
<lb n="50784"/>between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase
<lb n="50785"/>and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist
<lb n="50786"/>mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and
<lb n="50787"/>began to examine it closely, turning it over and over.
<lb n="50788"/><said who="???">--Next business? said MacCann. Hom!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50789"/>He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and
<lb n="50790"/>tugged twice at  the strawcoloured goatee which hung from his
<lb n="50791"/>blunt chin.
<lb n="50792"/><said who="???">--The next business is to sign the testimonial.</said>
<lb n="50793"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen.</said>
<lb n="50794"/><said who="???">--I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50795"/>The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the
<lb n="50796"/>onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice.
<lb n="50797"/><said who="???">--By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a
<lb n="50798"/>mercenary notion.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50799"/>His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words.
<lb n="50800"/>He turned his olive face, equine in expression, towards Ste-
<lb n="50801"/>phen, inviting him to speak again.</p>
<p> <lb n="50802"/>MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar's@
<lb n="50803"/>rescript, of Stead, of general disarmament, arbitration in cases
<lb n="50804"/>of international disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new
<lb n="50805"/>humanity and the new gospel of life which would make it the
<lb n="50806"/>business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the
<lb n="50807"/>greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number.</p>
<p> <lb n="50808"/>The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by
<lb n="50809"/>crying:
<lb n="50810"/><said who="???">--Three cheers for universal brotherhood!</said>
<lb n="50811"/><said who="???">--Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll
<lb n="50812"/>stand you a pint after.</said>
<lb n="50813"/><said who="???">--I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple,
<lb n="50814"/>glancing about him out of his dark@ oval eyes. Marx is only a
<lb n="50815"/>bloody cod.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50816"/>Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling
<lb n="50817"/>uneasily, and repeated:
<lb n="50818"/><said who="???">--Easy, easy, easy!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50819"/>Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth
<lb n="50820"/>flecked by a thin foam:
<lb n="50821"/><said who="???">--Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in
<lb n="50822"/>Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. Two
<lb n="50823"/>hundred years ago. He denounced priestcraft.@ The@ philosopher
<lb n="50824"/>of <place><location><geo>51.520987 -0.415985</geo></location><placeName>Middlesex</placeName></place>. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50825"/>A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied:
<lb n="50826"/><said who="???">--Pip! pip!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50827"/>Moynihan murmured beside Stephen's ear:
<lb n="50828"/><said who="???">--And what about John Anthony's poor little sister:</p>
<lg>
<lb n="50829"/><l>Lottie Collins lost her drawers;</l>
<lb n="50830"/>><l>Won't you kindly lend her yours?</l></said>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="50831"/>Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result,
<lb n="50832"/>murmured again:
<lb n="50833"/><said who="???">--We'll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins.</said>
<lb n="50834"/><said who="???">--I am waiting for your answer, said MacCann briefly.</said>
<lb n="50835"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen
<lb n="50836"/>wearily. You knew@ that well. Why do you make a scene about
<lb n="50837"/>it?</said>
<lb n="50838"/><said who="???">--Good! said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a reaction-
<lb n="50839"/>ary then?</said>
<lb n="50840"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Do you think you impress me, Stephen asked, when you
<lb n="50841"/>flourish your wooden sword?</said>
<lb n="50842"/><said who="???">--Metaphors! said MacCann bluntly. Come to facts.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50843"/>Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his
<lb n="50844"/>ground and said with hostile humour:
<lb n="50845"/><said who="???">--Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions as
<lb n="50846"/>the question of universal peace.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50847"/>Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the
<lb n="50848"/>two students by way of a peaceoffering, saying:
<lb n="50849"/><said who="???">--<seg xml:lang="la">Pax super totum sanguinarium globum.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50850"/>Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder
<lb n="50851"/>angrily in the direction of the Czar's@ image, saying:
<lb n="50852"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus@ let us have a legit-
<lb n="50853"/>imate Jesus.</said>
<lb n="50854"/><said who="???">--By hell, that's a good one! said the gipsy student to those
<lb n="50855"/>about him. That's a fine expression. I like that expression
<lb n="50856"/>immensely.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50857"/>He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulp-
<lb n="50858"/>ing down the phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed
<lb n="50859"/>cap, turned to Stephen, saying:
<lb n="50860"/><said who="???">--Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you
<lb n="50861"/>uttered just now?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50862"/>Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to
<lb n="50863"/>them:
<lb n="50864"/><said who="???">--I am curious to know now what he meant by that ex-
<lb n="50865"/>pression.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50866"/>He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper:
<lb n="50867"/><said who="???">--Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I don't
<lb n="50868"/>know if you believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the
<lb n="50869"/>mind of man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion
<lb n="50870"/>about the mind of Jesus?</said>
<lb n="50871"/><said who="???">--Go on, Temple, said the stout ruddy student@ returning, as
<lb n="50872"/>was his wont, to his first idea, that pint is waiting for you.</said>
<lb n="50873"/><said who="???">--He thinks I'm an imbecile, Temple explained to Stephen,
<lb n="50874"/>because I'm a  believer in the power of mind.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50875"/>Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer
<lb n="50876"/>and said:
<lb n="50877"/><said who="???">--<seg xml:lang="la">Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="50878"/>Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of
<lb n="50879"/>MacCann's flushed bluntfeatured face.
<lb n="50880"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--My signature is of no account, he said politely. You are right
<lb n="50881"/>to go your way. Leave me to go mine.</said>
<lb n="50882"/><said who="???">--Dedalus, said MacCann crisply, I believe you're a good fel-
<lb n="50883"/>low but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the
<lb n="50884"/>responsibility of the human individual.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50885"/>A voice said:
<lb n="50886"/><said who="???">--Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in
<lb n="50887"/>it.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50888"/>Stephen, recognising  the harsh tone of MacAlister's voice,
<lb n="50889"/>did not turn in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed sol-
<lb n="50890"/>emnly through the throng of students, linking Stephen and
<lb n="50891"/>Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to
<lb n="50892"/>the altar.</p>
<p> <lb n="50893"/>Temple bent eagerly across Cranly's breast and said:
<lb n="50894"/><said who="???">--Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is jealous
<lb n="50895"/>of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn't see that. By hell, I
<lb n="50896"/>saw that at once.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50897"/>As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in  the
<lb n="50898"/>act of escaping from the student with whom he had been con-
<lb n="50899"/>versing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the
<lb n="50900"/>lowest step, his threadbare  soutane gathered about him for
<lb n="50901"/>the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and
<lb n="50902"/>repeating:
<lb n="50903"/><said who="???">--Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very true!@ Not a doubt of it!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50904"/>In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality
<lb n="50905"/>was speaking earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a
<lb n="50906"/>boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a little his freckled brow and
<lb n="50907"/>bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil.
<lb n="50908"/><said who="???">--I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men are
<lb n="50909"/>pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the new-
<lb n="50910"/>comers.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50911"/>Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing
<lb n="50912"/>through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper:
<lb n="50913"/><said who="???">--Do you know that he is a married man? He was a married
<lb n="50914"/>man before they converted him. He has a wife and children
<lb n="50915"/>somewhere. By hell, I think that's the queerest notion I ever
<lb n="50916"/>heard! Eh?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50917"/>His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The mo-
<lb n="50918"/>ment they were through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely
<lb n="50919"/>by the neck and shook him, saying:
<lb n="50920"/><said who="???">--You flaming floundering fool! I'll take my dying bible there
<lb n="50921"/>isn't a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole
<lb n="50922"/>flaming bloody world!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50923"/>Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content,
<lb n="50924"/>while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake:
<lb n="50925"/><said who="???">--A flaming flaring  bloody idiot!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50926"/>They crossed the weedy garden together. The president,
<lb n="50927"/>wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them
<lb n="50928"/>along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the
<lb n="50929"/>walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students
<lb n="50930"/>saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They
<lb n="50931"/>walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen
<lb n="50932"/>could hear the thuds of the players' hands and the wet smacks
<lb n="50933"/>of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each
<lb n="50934"/>stroke.</p>
<p> <lb n="50935"/>The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat
<lb n="50936"/>to follow the game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across
<lb n="50937"/>to Stephen and said:
<lb n="50938"/><said who="???">--Excuse me, I wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean
<lb n="50939"/>Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50940"/>Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken
<lb n="50941"/>stave of a cask from the grass at his foot, turned swiftly and
<lb n="50942"/>said sternly:
<lb n="50943"/><said who="???">--Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another word,
<lb n="50944"/>do you know, to anybody on any subject I'll kill you <seg xml:lang="la">super
<lb n="50945"/>spottum</seg>.</said>
<lb n="50946"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--He was like you, I fancy, said Stephen, an emotional man.</said>
<lb n="50947"/><said who="???">--Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to him
<lb n="50948"/>at all. Sure@ you might as well be talking, do you know, to a
<lb n="50949"/>flaming chamberpot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple.
<lb n="50950"/>For God'@ sake@ go home.</said>
<lb n="50951"/><said who="???">--I don't care a damn about you, Cranly, answered Temple,
<lb n="50952"/>moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Ste-
<lb n="50953"/>phen. He's the only man I see in this institution that has an
<lb n="50954"/>individual mind.</said>
<lb n="50955"/><said who="???">--Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for
<lb n="50956"/>you're a hopeless bloody man.</said>
<lb n="50957"/><said who="???">--I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly
<lb n="50958"/>expressed. And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50959"/>He sidled out of the alley, smiling slily. Cranly watched him
<lb n="50960"/>with a blank expressionless face.
<lb n="50961"/><said who="???">--Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-
<lb n="50962"/>wall?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50963"/>His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student
<lb n="50964"/>who lounged against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes.
<lb n="50965"/>The laugh, pitched in a high key and coming from a so muscu-
<lb n="50966"/>lar frame, seemed like the whinny of an elephant. The student's
<lb n="50967"/>body shook all over and, to ease his mirth, he rubbed both his
<lb n="50968"/>hands delightedly@ over  his groins.
<lb n="50969"/><said who="???">--Lynch is awake, said Cranly.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50970"/>Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward
<lb n="50971"/>his chest.
<lb n="50972"/><said who="???">--Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50973"/>Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:
<lb n="50974"/><said who="???">--Who has anything to say about my girth?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50975"/>Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle.
<lb n="50976"/>When their faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart,
<lb n="50977"/>panting. Stephen bent down towards Davin who, intent on the
<lb n="50978"/>game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others.
<lb n="50979"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign too?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50980"/>Davin nodded and said:
<lb n="50981"/><said who="???">--And you, Stevie?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50982"/>Stephen shook his head.
<lb n="50983"/><said who="???">--You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the short
<lb n="50984"/>pipe from his mouth. Always alone.</said>
<lb n="50985"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace,
<lb n="50986"/>said Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw
<lb n="50987"/>in your room.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="50988"/>As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quote:
<lb n="50989"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by num-
<lb n="50990"/>bers, salute, one, two!</said>
<lb n="50991"/><said who="???">--That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish nation-
<lb n="50992"/>alist, first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're a born
<lb n="50993"/>sneerer, Stevie.</said>
<lb n="50994"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said
<lb n="50995"/>Stephen, and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can
<lb n="50996"/>find you a few in this college.</said>
<lb n="50997"/><said who="???">--I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you talk
<lb n="50998"/>against English literature. Now you talk against the  Irish in-
<lb n="50999"/>formers. What with your name and your ideas ....@ Are you Irish
<lb n="51000"/>at all?</said>
<lb n="51001"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show you
<lb n="51002"/>the tree of my family, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="51003"/><said who="???">--Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish?
<lb n="51004"/>Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson?</said>
<lb n="51005"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--You know one reason why, answered Stephen.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51006"/>Davin tossed his head and laughed.
<lb n="51007"/><said who="???">--O, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain young
<lb n="51008"/>lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind,
<lb n="51009"/>Stevie. They were only talking and laughing.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51010"/>Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's
<lb n="51011"/>shoulder.
<lb n="51012"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first.@
<lb n="51013"/>The first morning we met you asked me to show you the
<lb n="51014"/>way to the matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on
<lb n="51015"/>the first syllable. You remember? Then you used to address the
<lb n="51016"/>jesuits as father, you remember? I ask myself about you: <emph>Is
<lb n="51017"/>he as innocent as his speech?</emph></said>
<lb n="51018"/><said who="???">--I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you
<lb n="51019"/>told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about your
<lb n="51020"/>private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my
<lb n="51021"/>dinner. I was quite bad. I was awake a long time that night.
<lb n="51022"/>Why did you tell me those things?</said>
<lb n="51023"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster.</said>
<lb n="51024"/><said who="???">--No, said Davin, but I wish you had not told me.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51025"/>A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's
<lb n="51026"/>friendliness.
<lb n="51027"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--This race and this country and this life produced me, he
<lb n="51028"/>said. I shall express myself as I am.</said>
<lb n="51029"/><said who="???">--Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In your heart you are an
<lb n="51030"/>Irishman but your pride is too powerful.</said>
<lb n="51031"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--My ancestors threw off their language and took on@ another,
<lb n="51032"/>Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject
<lb n="51033"/>them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and
<lb n="51034"/>person debts they made? What for?</said>
<lb n="51035"/><said who="???">--For our freedom, said Davin.</said>
<lb n="51036"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given up
<lb n="51037"/>to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of
<lb n="51038"/>Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the enemy or
<lb n="51039"/>failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another. And
<lb n="51040"/>you invite me to be one of you. I'd see you damned first.</said>
<lb n="51041"/><said who="???">--They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day will
<lb n="51042"/>come yet, believe me.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51043"/>Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an in-
<lb n="51044"/>stant.
<lb n="51045"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments I
<lb n="51046"/>told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than
<lb n="51047"/>the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this
<lb n="51048"/>country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight.
<lb n="51049"/>You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to
<lb n="51050"/>fly by those nets.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51051"/>Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe.
<lb n="51052"/><said who="???">--Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country comes
<lb n="51053"/>first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or a@ mystic after.</said>
<lb n="51054"/><said who="???">--Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold
<lb n="51055"/>violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51056"/>Davin rose from his box and went towards the players,
<lb n="51057"/>shaking his head sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him
<lb n="51058"/>and he was hotly disputing with Cranly and the two players
<lb n="51059"/>who had finished their game. A match of four was arranged,
<lb n="51060"/>Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it
<lb n="51061"/>rebound twice or thrice to his hand and then@ struck it strongly
<lb n="51062"/>and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer
<lb n="51063"/>to its thud:
<lb n="51064"/><said who="???">--Your soul!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51065"/>Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then
<lb n="51066"/>he plucked him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed,
<lb n="51067"/>saying:
<lb n="51068"/><said who="???">--Let us eke go, as Cranly has it.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51069"/>Stephen smiled at this sidethrust. They passed back through
<lb n="51070"/>the garden and out through the hall where the doddering porter
<lb n="51071"/>was pinning up a notice in the frame. At the foot of the steps
<lb n="51072"/>they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from his
<lb n="51073"/>pocket and offered it to his companion.
<lb n="51074"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I know you are poor, he said.</said>
<lb n="51075"/><said who="???">--Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51076"/>This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile
<lb n="51077"/>again.
<lb n="51078"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you
<lb n="51079"/>made up your mind to swear in yellow.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51080"/>They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a
<lb n="51081"/>pause Stephen began:
<lb n="51082"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say ...</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51083"/>Lynch halted and said bluntly:
<lb n="51084"/><said who="???">--Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a
<lb n="51085"/>yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51086"/>Stephen went on:
<lb n="51087"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of
<lb n="51088"/>whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and
<lb n="51089"/>unites it with the human sufferer.  Terror is the feeling which
<lb n="51090"/>arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever is grave and
<lb n="51091"/>constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret
<lb n="51092"/>cause.</said>
<lb n="51093"/><said who="???">--Repeat, said Lynch.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51094"/>Stephen repeated the definitions slowly.
<lb n="51095"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in <place><location><geo>51.507351 -0.127758</geo></location>
<lb n="51096"/><placeName>London</placeName></place>. She was on her way to meet her mother whom she
<lb n="51097"/>had not seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft
<lb n="51098"/>of a lorry shivered the window of the hansom in the shape of a
<lb n="51099"/>star. A long fine needle of the shivered glass pierced her heart.
<lb n="51100"/>She died on the instant. The reporter called it a tragic death. It
<lb n="51101"/>is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms
<lb n="51102"/>of my definitions.</said>
<lb n="51103"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">The@ tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways,
<lb n="51104"/>towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of
<lb n="51105"/>it. You see I use the word <emph>arrest</emph>. I mean that the tragic emotion
<lb n="51106"/>is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings ex-
<lb n="51107"/>cited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire
<lb n="51108"/>urges us to possess, to go to something,@ loathing  urges us to
<lb n="51109"/>abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions.
<lb n="51110"/>The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are
<lb n="51111"/>therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general
<lb n="51112"/>term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above
<lb n="51113"/>desire and loathing.</said>
<lb n="51114"/><said who="???">--You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told
<lb n="51115"/>you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of
<lb n="51116"/>the Venus of Praxiteles in the <place><location><geo>53.339706 -6.252188</geo></location><placeName>Museum</placeName></place>. Was that not desire?</said>
<lb n="51117"/><said who="???">--I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me
<lb n="51118"/>that when you were a boy in that charming carmelite school
<lb n="51119"/>you ate pieces of dried cowdung.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51120"/>Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again
<lb n="51121"/>rubbed both his hands over his groins but without taking them
<lb n="51122"/>from his pockets.
<lb n="51123"/><said who="???">--O I did! I did! he cried.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51124"/>Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him
<lb n="51125"/>for a moment boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his
<lb n="51126"/>laughter, answered his look from his humbled eyes. The long
<lb n="51127"/>slender flattened skull beneath the long pointed cap brought
<lb n="51128"/>before Stephen's mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes,
<lb n="51129"/>too, were reptilelike in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant,
<lb n="51130"/>humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one tiny
<lb n="51131"/>human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and
<lb n="51132"/>selfembittered.
<lb n="51133"/><said who="???">--As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all
<lb n="51134"/>animals. I also am an animal.</said>
<lb n="51135"/><said who="???">--You are, said Lynch.</said>
<lb n="51136"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">">--But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued.
<lb n="51137"/>The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are
<lb n="51138"/>really not esthetic@ emotions not only because they are kinetic
<lb n="51139"/>in character but also because they are not more than physical.
<lb n="51140"/>Our flesh shrinks from what it dreads and responds to the
<lb n="51141"/>stimulus of what it desires by a purely reflex action of the nerv-
<lb n="51142"/>ous system. Our eyelid closes before we are aware that the fly is
<lb n="51143"/>about to enter our eye.</said>
<lb n="51144"/><said who="???">--Not always, said Lynch critically.</said>
<lb n="51145"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">">--In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the
<lb n="51146"/>stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex
<lb n="51147"/>action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot
<lb n="51148"/>awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which
<lb n="51149"/>is purely physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces,
<lb n="51150"/>or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal
<lb n="51151"/>terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged and at last dissolved by
<lb n="51152"/>what I call the rhythm of beauty.</said>
<lb n="51153"/><said who="???">--What is that exactly? asked Lynch.</said>
<lb n="51154"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of
<lb n="51155"/>part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its
<lb n="51156"/>part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a
<lb n="51157"/>part.</said>
<lb n="51158"/><said who="???">--If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call
<lb n="51159"/>beauty: and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cow-
<lb n="51160"/>dung once, that I admire only beauty.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51161"/>Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then,  blushing
<lb n="51162"/>slightly, he laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve.
<lb n="51163"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of
<lb n="51164"/>these things and to try to understand their nature and, having
<lb n="51165"/>understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to
<lb n="51166"/>express, to press out again, from the gross earth or what it
<lb n="51167"/>brings forth, from sound and shape and colour which are the
<lb n="51168"/>prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty we have come
<lb n="51169"/>to understand &ndash;@ that is art.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51170"/>They had reached the <place><location><geo>53.342399 -6.238434</geo></location><placeName>canal bridge</placeName></place> and, turning from their
<lb n="51171"/>course, went on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the
<lb n="51172"/>sluggish water, and a smell of wet branches over their heads
<lb n="51173"/>seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought.
<lb n="51174"/><said who="???">--But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What
<lb n="51175"/>is art? What is the beauty it expresses?</said>
<lb n="51176"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded
<lb n="51177"/>wretch, said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the
<lb n="51178"/>matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his
<lb n="51179"/>temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.</said>
<lb n="51180"/><said who="???">--I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat
<lb n="51181"/>devils of pigs.</said>
<lb n="51182"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or
<lb n="51183"/>intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs
<lb n="51184"/>and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51185"/>Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:
<lb n="51186"/><said who="???">--If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least
<lb n="51187"/>another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about
<lb n="51188"/>women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five
<lb n="51189"/>hundred a year. You can't get me one.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51190"/>Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the
<lb n="51191"/>last one that remained, saying simply:
<lb n="51192"/><said who="???">--Proceed!</said>
<lb n="51193"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehen-
<lb n="51194"/>sion of which pleases.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51195"/>Lynch nodded.
<lb n="51196"/><said who="???">--I remember that, he said. <seg xml:lang="la">Pulcra sunt quae visa placent.</seg></said>
<lb n="51197"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--He uses the word <seg xml:lang="la">visa</seg>, said Stephen, to cover esthetic appre-
<lb n="51198"/>hension of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or
<lb n="51199"/>through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though
<lb n="51200"/>it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which
<lb n="51201"/>excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a
<lb n="51202"/>kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the
<lb n="51203"/>mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the
<lb n="51204"/>hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle.</said>
<lb n="51205"/><said who="???">--No, said Lynch.@ Give@ me the hypothenuse of the Venus of
<lb n="51206"/>Praxiteles.</said>
<lb n="51207"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that
<lb n="51208"/>beauty is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a
<lb n="51209"/>meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld
<lb n="51210"/>by the intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying
<lb n="51211"/>relations of the intelligible:  beauty is beheld by the imagination
<lb n="51212"/>which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sen-
<lb n="51213"/>sible. The first step in the direction of truth is to understand the
<lb n="51214"/>frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the act
<lb n="51215"/>itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system of philosophy
<lb n="51216"/>rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his
<lb n="51217"/>statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time and
<lb n="51218"/>in the same connection belong to and not belong to the same
<lb n="51219"/>subject. The first step in the direction of beauty is to under-
<lb n="51220"/>stand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend
<lb n="51221"/>the act itself of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear?</said>
<lb n="51222"/><said who="???">--But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with an-
<lb n="51223"/>other definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you
<lb n="51224"/>and Aquinas can do?</said>
<lb n="51225"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Let us take woman, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="51226"/><said who="???">--Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.</said>
<lb n="51227"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot,
<lb n="51228"/>said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That
<lb n="51229"/>seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see
<lb n="51230"/>however two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physi-
<lb n="51231"/>cal quality admired by men in women is in direct connection
<lb n="51232"/>with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of
<lb n="51233"/>the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than
<lb n="51234"/>even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out.
<lb n="51235"/>It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of
<lb n="51236"/>the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with
<lb n="51237"/>one hand on <emph>The Origin of Species</emph> and the other hand on the
<lb n="51238"/>new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of
<lb n="51239"/>Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring
<lb n="51240"/>and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would
<lb n="51241"/>give good milk to her children and yours.</said>
<lb n="51242"/><said who="???">--Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch energeti-
<lb n="51243"/>cally.</said>
<lb n="51244"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--There remains another way out, said Stephen@ laughing.
<lb n="51245"/><said who="???">--To wit? said Lynch.</said>
<lb n="51246"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--This hypothesis, Stephen began.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51247"/>A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of
<lb n="51248"/><place><location><geo>53.339029 -6.241523</geo></location><placeName>sir Patrick Dun's</placeName></place> hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech
<lb n="51249"/>with the harsh roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed
<lb n="51250"/>his ears and gave out oath after oath till the dray had passed.
<lb n="51251"/>Then he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen turned also and
<lb n="51252"/>waited for a few moments till his companion's illhumour had
<lb n="51253"/>had its vent.
<lb n="51254"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out:
<lb n="51255"/>that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all
<lb n="51256"/>people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it
<lb n="51257"/>certain relations which satisfy and coincide with the stages
<lb n="51258"/>themselves of all esthetic apprehension. These relations of the
<lb n="51259"/>sensible, visible to you through one form and to me through
<lb n="51260"/>another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty.
<lb n="51261"/>Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another
<lb n="51262"/>pennyworth of wisdom.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51263"/>Lynch laughed.
<lb n="51264"/><said who="???">--It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time
<lb n="51265"/>after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your
<lb n="51266"/>sleeve?</said>
<lb n="51267"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic the-
<lb n="51268"/>ory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy
<lb n="51269"/>extends Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we
<lb n="51270"/>come to the phenomenon@ of artistic conception, artistic gesta-
<lb n="51271"/>tion and artistic reproduction I require a new terminology and
<lb n="51272"/>a new personal experience.</said>
<lb n="51273"/><said who="???">--Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his
<lb n="51274"/>intellect, was exactly a good round  friar. But you will tell me
<lb n="51275"/>about the new personal experience and new terminology some
<lb n="51276"/>other day. Hurry up and finish the first part.</said>
<lb n="51277"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Who knows? said Stephen@ smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would
<lb n="51278"/>understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He
<lb n="51279"/>wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words
<lb n="51280"/><seg xml:lang="la">Pange lingua gloriosi</seg>. They say it is the highest glory of the
<lb n="51281"/>hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing hymn.  I like it: but there
<lb n="51282"/>is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and majestic
<lb n="51283"/>processional song, the <seg xml:lang="la">Vexilla Regis</seg> of <seg xml:lang="la">Venantius Fortunatus</seg>.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51284"/>Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass
<lb n="51285"/>voice:
<lg type="song" xml:lang="la">

<lb n="51290"/><said who="???">--That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51291"/>They turned into <place><location><geo>53.338573 -6.243389</geo></location><placeName>Lower Mount Street</placeName></place>. A few steps from the
<lb n="51292"/>corner a fat young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them
<lb n="51293"/>and stopped.
<lb n="51294"/><said who="???">--Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was
<lb n="51295"/>plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil.
<lb n="51296"/>Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughenessy@ got four-
<lb n="51297"/>teenth. The Irish fellows in Clarke's gave them a feed last night.
<lb n="51298"/>They all ate curry.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51299"/>His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as
<lb n="51300"/>he had advanced through his tidings of success, his small
<lb n="51301"/>fatencircled eyes vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing
<lb n="51302"/>voice out of hearing.</p>
<p> <lb n="51303"/>In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice
<lb n="51304"/>came forth again from their lurkingplaces.
<lb n="51305"/><said who="???">--Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathemat-
<lb n="51306"/>ics and I'm taking constitutional history. There are twenty
<lb n="51307"/>subjects. I'm taking botany too. You know I'm a member of the
<lb n="51308"/>field club.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51309"/>He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and
<lb n="51310"/>placed a plump woollengloved hand on his breast@ from which
<lb n="51311"/>muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth.
<lb n="51312"/><said who="???">--Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out@
<lb n="51313"/>said Stephen drily, to make a stew.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51314"/>The fat student laughed indulgently and said:
<lb n="51315"/><said who="???">--We are all  highly respectable people in the field club. Last
<lb n="51316"/>Saturday we went out to <place><location><geo>52.957720 -6.354370</geo></location><placeName>Glenmalure</placeName></place>, seven of us.</said>
<lb n="51317"/><said who="???">--With women, Donovan? said Lynch.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51318"/>Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said:
<lb n="51319"/><said who="???">--Our end is the acquisition of knowledge.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51320"/>Then he said quickly:
<lb n="51321"/><said who="???">--I hear you are writing some essay about esthetics.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51322"/>Stephen made a vague gesture of denial.
<lb n="51323"/><said who="???">--Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on
<lb n="51324"/>that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and
<lb n="51325"/>all that. The <emph>Laocoon</emph> interested me very much when I read it.
<lb n="51326"/>Of course it is idealistic, German, ultraprofound.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51327"/>Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them
<lb n="51328"/>urbanely.
<lb n="51329"/><said who="???">--I must go, he said softly and benevolently. I have a strong
<lb n="51330"/>suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister
<lb n="51331"/>intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the Don-
<lb n="51332"/>ovan family.</said>
<lb n="51333"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the turnips
<lb n="51334"/>for me and my mate.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51335"/>Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his
<lb n="51336"/>face resembled a devil's mask:
<lb n="51337"/><said who="???">--To think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get a
<lb n="51338"/>good job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap ciga-
<lb n="51339"/>rettes!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51340"/>They turned their faces towards <place><location><geo>53.339658 -6.249165</geo></location><placeName>Merrion Square</placeName></place> and went
<lb n="51341"/>on for a little in silence.
<lb n="51342"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, the
<lb n="51343"/>most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore corre-
<lb n="51344"/>spond to the necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find
<lb n="51345"/>these and you find the qualities of universal beauty. Aquinas
<lb n="51346"/>says: <seg xml:lang="la">ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur, integritas, consonantia,
<lb n="51347"/>claritas</seg>. I translate it so: <emph>Three things are needed for beauty,
<lb n="51348"/>wholeness, harmony and radiance</emph>. Do these correspond to the
<lb n="51349"/>phases of apprehension? Are you following?</said>
<lb n="51350"/><said who="???">--Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excre-
<lb n="51351"/>mentitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen
<lb n="51352"/>to you.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51353"/>Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung
<lb n="51354"/>inverted on his head.
<lb n="51355"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Look at that basket, he said.</said>
<lb n="51356"/><said who="???">--I see it, said Lynch.</said>
<lb n="51357"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of
<lb n="51358"/>all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe
<lb n="51359"/>which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a
<lb n="51360"/>bounding line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An
<lb n="51361"/>esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time.
<lb n="51362"/>What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented
<lb n="51363"/>in space. But@ temporal or spatial@ the esthetic image is first
<lb n="51364"/>luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained
<lb n="51365"/>upon the immeasurable background of space or time which is
<lb n="51366"/>not it. You apprehend it as <emph>one</emph>@ thing. You see it as one whole.
<lb n="51367"/>You apprehend its wholeness. That is <seg xml:lang="la">integritas</seg>.</said>
<lb n="51368"/><said who="???">--Bull's eye! said Lynch@ laughing. Go on.</said>
<lb n="51369"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its
<lb n="51370"/>formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part
<lb n="51371"/>within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other
<lb n="51372"/>words the synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the
<lb n="51373"/>analysis of apprehension. Having first felt that it is <emph>one</emph>@ thing
<lb n="51374"/>you feel now that it is a <emph>thing</emph>. You apprehend it as complex,
<lb n="51375"/>multiple, divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of
<lb n="51376"/>its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is <seg xml:lang="la">consonantia</seg>.</said>
<lb n="51377"/><said who="???">--Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is
<lb n="51378"/><seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> and you win the cigar.</said>
<lb n="51379"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague.
<lb n="51380"/>Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me
<lb n="51381"/>for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in
<lb n="51382"/>mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty
<lb n="51383"/>being a light from some other world, the idea of which the
<lb n="51384"/>matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the
<lb n="51385"/>symbol. I thought he might mean that <seg xml:lang="la">claritas</seg> is the artistic
<lb n="51386"/>discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything
<lb n="51387"/>or a force of generalisation which would make the esthetic
<lb n="51388"/>image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions.
<lb n="51389"/>But that is literary talk. I understand it so. When you have
<lb n="51390"/>apprehended that basket as one thing and have then  analysed it
<lb n="51391"/>according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make
<lb n="51392"/>the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permiss-
<lb n="51393"/>ible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing.
<lb n="51394"/>The radiance of which he speaks is the scholastic <seg xml:lang="la">quidditas</seg>, the
<lb n="51395"/><emph>whatness</emph> of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist
<lb n="51396"/>when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination.
<lb n="51397"/>The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully
<lb n="51398"/>to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of
<lb n="51399"/>beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended
<lb n="51400"/>luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its whole-
<lb n="51401"/>ness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis
<lb n="51402"/>of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac
<lb n="51403"/>condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a
<lb n="51404"/>phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment
<lb n="51405"/>of the heart.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51406"/>Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak,
<lb n="51407"/>felt that his words had called up around them a thoughten-
<lb n="51408"/>chanted silence.
<lb n="51409"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the
<lb n="51410"/>wider sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the
<lb n="51411"/>literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense.
<lb n="51412"/>When we speak of beauty in the second sense of the term our
<lb n="51413"/>judgment is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by
<lb n="51414"/>the form of that art. The image, it is clear, must be set between
<lb n="51415"/>the mind or senses of the  artist himself and the mind or senses
<lb n="51416"/>of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art
<lb n="51417"/>necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one
<lb n="51418"/>to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein
<lb n="51419"/>the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself;
<lb n="51420"/>the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in
<lb n="51421"/>mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form,
<lb n="51422"/>the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to
<lb n="51423"/>others.</said>

<lb n="51429"/>which I am trying to explain. Here are some questions I set
<lb n="51430"/>myself: <emph>Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the portrait of
<lb n="51431"/>Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of sir@ Philip

<lb n="51439"/>true scholastic stink.</said>
<lb n="51440"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of
<lb n="51441"/>statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the
<lb n="51442"/>forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even
<lb n="51443"/>in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are
<lb n="51444"/>often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal
<lb n="51445"/>vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages
<lb n="51446"/>ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged
<lb n="51447"/>stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the
<lb n="51448"/>instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The
<lb n="51449"/>simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature
<lb n="51450"/>when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre
<lb n="51451"/>of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of
<lb n="51452"/>emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and
<lb n="51453"/>from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The
<lb n="51454"/>personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing
<lb n="51455"/>round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea.
<lb n="51456"/>This progress you will see easily in that old English ballad
<lb n="51457"/><emph>Turpin Hero</emph> which begins in the first person and ends in the
<lb n="51458"/>third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality
<lb n="51459"/>which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every
<lb n="51460"/>person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper
<lb n="51461"/>and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist@ at first
<lb n="51462"/>a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent
<lb n="51463"/>narrative finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises
<lb n="51464"/>itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is
<lb n="51465"/>life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination.
<lb n="51466"/>The mystery of esthetic like that of material creation is accom-
<lb n="51467"/>plished. The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within
<lb n="51468"/>or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined
<lb n="51469"/>out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.</said>
<lb n="51470"/><said who="???">--Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51471"/>A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they

<lb n="51477"/>work after having perpetrated this country.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51478"/>The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage
<lb n="51479"/>beside<place><location><geo>53.340762 -6.258382</geo></location><placeName>Kildare house@</placeName></place> they found many students sheltering un-
<lb n="51480"/>der the arcade of the library. Cranly@ leaning against a pillar@
<lb n="51481"/>was picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some
<lb n="51482"/>companions. Some girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch
<lb n="51483"/>whispered to Stephen:
<lb n="51484"/><said who="???">--Your beloved is  here.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51485"/>Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group
<lb n="51486"/>of students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes
<lb n="51487"/>towards her  from time to time. She too stood silently among
<lb n="51488"/>her companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with
<lb n="51489"/>conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last.
<lb n="51490"/>Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory and courage,
<lb n="51491"/>lapsed back into a listless peace.</p>
<p> <lb n="51492"/>He heard the students talking among themselves. They
<lb n="51493"/>spoke of two friends who had passed the final medical exam-
<lb n="51494"/>ination, of the chances of getting places on ocean liners, of
<lb n="51495"/>poor and rich practices.

<p> <lb n="51509"/>Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in inter-

<lb n="51511"/>companions.</p>
<p> <lb n="51512"/>The quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of
<lb n="51513"/>diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exha-
<lb n="51514"/>lation was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their trim
<lb n="51515"/>boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade@
<lb n="51516"/>talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their
<lb n="51517"/>umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops,
<lb n="51518"/>closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.</p>
<p> <lb n="51519"/>And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple

<p> <lb n="51523"/>Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was
<lb n="51524"/>all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light
<lb n="51525"/>had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters,
<lb n="51526"/>conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to
<lb n="51527"/>a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A
<lb n="51528"/>spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving
<lb n="51529"/>as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly@
<lb n="51530"/>as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His
<lb n="51531"/>soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that
<lb n="51532"/>windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants
<lb n="51533"/>open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.</p>
<p> <lb n="51534"/>An enchantment of the heart! The night had been enchanted. In
<lb n="51535"/>dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life.
<lb n="51536"/>Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and days
<lb n="51537"/>and years and ages?</p>
<p> <lb n="51538"/>The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from
<lb n="51539"/>all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstance of
<lb n="51540"/>what had happened or of what might have happened. The in-
<lb n="51541"/>stant flashed forth like a point of light and now from cloud on
<lb n="51542"/>cloud of vague circumstance confused form  was veiling softly
<lb n="51543"/>its afterglow. O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the
<lb n="51544"/>word was made flesh. Gabriel the  seraph had come to the
<lb n="51545"/>virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit,
<lb n="51546"/>whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and
<lb n="51547"/>ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange wilful
<lb n="51548"/>heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful
<lb n="51549"/>from before the beginning of the world: and lured by that
<lb n="51550"/>ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim were falling
<lb n="51551"/>from heaven.</p>
<lg>
<lb n="51552"/><l>Are you not weary of ardent ways,</l>
<lb n="51553"/><l>Lure of the fallen seraphim?</l>
<lb n="51554"/><l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="51555"/>The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring
<lb n="51556"/>them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass
<lb n="51557"/>through them. The roselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme;
<lb n="51558"/>ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world,
<lb n="51559"/>consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose
<lb n="51560"/>that was her wilful heart.</p>
<lg>
<lb n="51561"/><l>Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze</l>
<lb n="51562"/><l>And you have had your will of him.</l>
<lb n="51563"/><l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="51564"/>And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to
<lb n="51565"/>move and beat. And then? Smoke, incense ascending from the
<lb n="51566"/>altar of the world.</p>
<lg>
<lb n="51567"/><l>Above the flame the smoke of praise</l>
<lb n="51568"/><l>Goes up from ocean rim to rim.</l>
<lb n="51569"/<<l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="51570"/>Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury
<lb n="51571"/>oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging
<lb n="51572"/>swaying smoking [swaying]@ censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal ball.
<lb n="51573"/>The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken.
<lb n="51574"/>His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then
<lb n="51575"/>went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and
<lb n="51576"/>baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken.</p>
<p> <lb n="51577"/>The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes
<lb n="51578"/>of the naked window the morning light was gathering. A bell
<lb n="51579"/>beat faintly very far away. A bird twittered; two birds, three.
<lb n="51580"/>The bell and the birds@ ceased: and the dull white light  spread
<lb n="51581"/>itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight
<lb n="51582"/>in his heart.</p>
<p> <lb n="51583"/>Fearing to lose all@ he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to
<lb n="51584"/>look for paper and pencil. There was neither on the table; only
<lb n="51585"/>the soup plate@ he had eaten the rice from for supper and the
<lb n="51586"/>candlestick with its tendrils of tallow and its paper socket,
<lb n="51587"/>singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily towards
<lb n="51588"/>the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the
<lb n="51589"/>coat that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a
<lb n="51590"/>cigarette packet.  He  lay back and, tearing open the packet,
<lb n="51591"/>placed the last cigarette on the window ledge@ and began to
<lb n="51592"/>write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the
<lb n="51593"/>rough cardboard surface.</p>
<p> <lb n="51594"/>Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow,
<lb n="51595"/>murmuring them again. The lumps of knotted flock under his
<lb n="51596"/>head reminded him of the lumps of knotted horsehair in the
<lb n="51597"/>sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling or serious,
<lb n="51598"/>asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with
<lb n="51599"/>himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the
<lb n="51600"/>untenanted sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the
<lb n="51601"/>talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs. Then he saw
<lb n="51602"/>himself sitting at the old piano, striking chords softly from its
<lb n="51603"/>speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen again
<lb n="51604"/>in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty
<lb n="51605"/>song of the Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the
<lb n="51606"/>victory chant of Agincourt, the happy air of Greensleeves.
<lb n="51607"/>While he sang and she listened, or feigned to listen, his heart
<lb n="51608"/>was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he
<lb n="51609"/>heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own
<lb n="51610"/>sarcasm: the house where young men are called by their chris-
<lb n="51611"/>tian names a little too soon.</p>
<p> <lb n="51612"/>At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he
<lb n="51613"/>had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his
<lb n="51614"/>memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball.@ Her@
<lb n="51615"/>white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She
<lb n="51616"/>danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and,
<lb n="51617"/>as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was
<lb n="51618"/>on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had
<lb n="51619"/>lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.
<lb n="51620"/><said who="???">--You are a great stranger now.</said>
<lb n="51621"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes. I was born to be a monk.</said>
<lb n="51622"/><said who="???">--I am afraid you are a heretic.</said>
<lb n="51623"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Are you much afraid?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51624"/>For answer she had danced away from him along the chain
<lb n="51625"/>of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to none.
<lb n="51626"/>The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in
<lb n="51627"/>shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.</p>
<p> <lb n="51628"/>A monk! His own image started forth a profaner of the
<lb n="51629"/>cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve,
<lb n="51630"/>spinning like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino@ a lithe web of
<lb n="51631"/>sophistry and whispering in her ear.</p>
<p> <lb n="51632"/>No, it was not his image. It was@ the image of the young
<lb n="51633"/>priest in whose company he had seen her last, looking at him
<lb n="51634"/>out of dove's eyes, toying with the pages of her Irish phrase-
<lb n="51635"/>book.
<lb n="51636"/><said who="???">--Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it every
<lb n="51637"/>day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has.</said>
<lb n="51638"/><said who="???">--And the church, Father Moran?</said>
<lb n="51639"/><said who="???">--The church too. Coming round too. The work is going
<lb n="51640"/>ahead there too. Don't fret about the church.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51641"/>Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had
<lb n="51642"/>done well not to salute her on the steps of the library. He had
<lb n="51643"/>done well to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a
<lb n="51644"/>church which was the scullerymaid of christendom.</p>
<p> <lb n="51645"/>Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy
<lb n="51646"/>from his soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the
<lb n="51647"/>fragments on all sides. On all sides distorted reflections of her
<lb n="51648"/>image started from his memory: the flowergirl@ in the ragged
<lb n="51649"/>dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden's face who had
<lb n="51650"/>called herself his own girl and begged his handsel, the kitchen-
<lb n="51651"/>girl in the next house who sang over the clatter of her plates
<lb n="51652"/>with the drawl of a country singer the first bars of <emph>By
<lb n="51653"/><emph>Killarney's Lakes and Fells</emph>, a girl who had laughed gaily to see
<lb n="51654"/>him stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near <place><location><geo>53.343835 -6.267562</geo></location><placeName>Cork
<lb n="51655"/>Hill</placeName></place> had caught the broken sole of his shoe, a girl he had
<lb n="51656"/>glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth@ as she passed out
<lb n="51657"/>of Jacob's biscuit factory, who had cried to him over her shoul-
<lb n="51658"/>der:
<lb n="51659"/><said who="???">--Do you like what you seen of me, straight hair and curly
<lb n="51660"/>eyebrows?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51661"/>And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her
<lb n="51662"/>image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the
<lb n="51663"/>classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that
<lb n="51664"/>perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those dark eyes upon
<lb n="51665"/>which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told him-
<lb n="51666"/>self bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a
<lb n="51667"/>figure of the womanhood of her country, a batlike soul waking
<lb n="51668"/>to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and lone-
<lb n="51669"/>liness, tarrying a while,@ loveless and sinless, with her mild lover
<lb n="51670"/>and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the
<lb n="51671"/>latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in
<lb n="51672"/>coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and
<lb n="51673"/>features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a
<lb n="51674"/>brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in <place><location><geo>53.338748 -9.181478</geo></location>
<lb n="51675"/><placeName>Moycullen</placeName></place>. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness,
<lb n="51676"/>to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite
<lb n="51677"/>rather than to him, a priest of the@ eternal imagination, trans-
<lb n="51678"/>muting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of
<lb n="51679"/>everliving life.</p>
<p> <lb n="51680"/>The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant
<lb n="51681"/>his bitter and despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken
<lb n="51682"/>in a hymn of thanksgiving.</p>
<lg>
<lb n="51683"/><l>Our broken cries and mournful lays</l>
<lb n="51584"/><l>Rise in one eucharistic hymn.</l>
<lb n="51585"/><l>Are you not weary of ardent ways?</l>
<lb n="51686"/><l>While sacrificing hands upraise</l>
<lb n="51587"/><l>The chalice flowing to the brim.</l>
<lb n="51588"/><l>Tell no more of enchanted days.</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="51689"/>He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music
<lb n="51690"/>and rhythm suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence;
<lb n="51691"/>then copied them painfully to feel them the better by seeing
<lb n="51692"/>them; then lay back on his bolster.</p>
<p> <lb n="51693"/>The full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard:
<lb n="51694"/>but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in
<lb n="51695"/>common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from
<lb n="51696"/>that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the
<lb n="51697"/>blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of
<lb n="51698"/>the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in
<lb n="51699"/>their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay
<lb n="51700"/>upwards to heaven all strewn  with scarlet flowers. Weary!
<lb n="51701"/>Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.</p>
<p> <lb n="51702"/>A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him@
<lb n="51703"/>descending along his spine from his closely cowled  head. He
<lb n="51704"/>felt it descend and, seeing himself as he lay, smiled. Soon he
<lb n="51705"/>would sleep.</p>
<p> <lb n="51706"/>He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years
<lb n="51707"/>before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, send-
<lb n="51708"/>ing sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her
<lb n="51709"/>foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown
<lb n="51710"/>horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in
<lb n="51711"/>admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nod-
<lb n="51712"/>ding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the
<lb n="51713"/>steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came
<lb n="51714"/>up to his step many times between their phrases and went
<lb n="51715"/>down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting
<lb n="51716"/>to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!</p>
<p> <lb n="51717"/>Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he
<lb n="51718"/>sent her the verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid
<lb n="51719"/>the tapping of eggshells. Folly indeed! The brothers would
<lb n="51720"/>laugh and try to wrest the page from each other with their
<lb n="51721"/>strong hard fingers. The suave priest, her uncle, seated in his
<lb n="51722"/>armchair, would hold the page at arm's length, read it smiling
<lb n="51723"/>and approve of the literary form.</p>
<p> <lb n="51724"/>No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she
<lb n="51725"/>would not show them to others. No, no: she could not.</p>
<p> <lb n="51726"/>He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her
<lb n="51727"/>innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had
<lb n="51728"/>never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it
<lb n="51729"/>through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood
<lb n="51730"/>while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her
<lb n="51731"/>nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun
<lb n="51732"/>to live as his soul had when he had first sinned: and a tender
<lb n="51733"/>compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor
<lb n="51734"/>and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the dark shame of
<lb n="51735"/>womanhood.</p>
<p> <lb n="51736"/>While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had
<lb n="51737"/>she been? Might it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life,
<lb n="51738"/>that her soul at those same moments had been conscious of his
<lb n="51739"/>homage? It might be.</p>
<p> <lb n="51740"/>A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and ful-
<lb n="51741"/>filled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from
<lb n="51742"/>odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark
<lb n="51743"/>and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her
<lb n="51744"/>nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish-
<lb n="51745"/>limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like
<lb n="51746"/>water with a liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like
<lb n="51747"/>waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, sym-
<lb n="51748"/>bols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain.</p>

<p> <lb n="51768"/>What birds were they?
<p> <lb n="51769"/>He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning
<lb n="51770"/>wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting
<lb n="51771"/>shoulder of a house in <place><location><geo>53.340809 -6.257636</geo></location><placeName>Molesworth</placeName></place> Street. The air of the late
<lb n="51772"/>March evening made clear their flight, their dark darting
<lb n="51773"/>quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a
<lb n="51774"/>limphung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.</p>
<p> <lb n="51775"/>He watched their flight:@ bird after bird: a dark flash, a
<lb n="51776"/>swerve, a flash again, a dart aside, a curve, a flutter of wings.
<lb n="51777"/>He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies
<lb n="51778"/>passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in
<lb n="51779"/>number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from
<lb n="51780"/>the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round
<lb n="51781"/>and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left
<lb n="51782"/>to right, circling about a temple of air.</p>
<p> <lb n="51783"/>He  listened to their@ cries: like the squeak of mice behind the
<lb n="51784"/>wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and
<lb n="51785"/>shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, falling a third or a
<lb n="51786"/>fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry
<lb n="51787"/>was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of silken
<lb n="51788"/>light unwound from whirring spools.</p>
<p> <lb n="51789"/>The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his
<lb n="51790"/>mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the
<lb n="51791"/>dark frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerv-
<lb n="51792"/>ing round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes
<lb n="51793"/>which still saw the image of his mother's face.</p>
<p> <lb n="51794"/>Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch,
<lb n="51795"/>hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an
<lb n="51796"/>augury of good or evil? A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew
<lb n="51797"/>through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shape-
<lb n="51798"/>less thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds
<lb n="51799"/>to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air
<lb n="51800"/>have their knowledge and know their times and seasons be-
<lb n="51801"/>cause they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have
<lb n="51802"/>not perverted that order by reason.</p>
<p> <lb n="51803"/>And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at
<lb n="51804"/>birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think
<lb n="51805"/>vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he
<lb n="51806"/>leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear
<lb n="51807"/>of the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of
<lb n="51808"/>symbols and portents, of the hawklike man whose name he
<lb n="51809"/>bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings, of
<lb n="51810"/>Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet
<lb n="51811"/>and bearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon.</p>
<p> <lb n="51812"/>He smiled as he thought of the god's image for it made him
<lb n="51813"/>think of a bottlenosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a
<lb n="51814"/>document which he held at arm's length and he knew that he
<lb n="51815"/>would not have remembered the god's name but that it was like
<lb n="51816"/>an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly that he was
<lb n="51817"/>about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into
<lb n="51818"/>which he had been born and the order of life out of which he
<lb n="51819"/>had come?</p>
<p> <lb n="51820"/>They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of
<lb n="51821"/>the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were
<lb n="51822"/>they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come
<lb n="51823"/>back from the south. Then he was to go away?@ for they were
<lb n="51824"/>birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home
<lb n="51825"/>under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes
<lb n="51826"/>they had built to wander.</p>
<lg>
<lb n="51827"/><l>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel.</l>
<lb n="51828"/><l>I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes</l>
<lb n="51829"/><l>Upon the nest under the eave before</l>
<lb n="51830"/><l>He wander the loud waters.</l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="51831"/>A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over
<lb n="51832"/>his memory and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent
<lb n="51833"/>spaces of fading tenuous sky above the waters, of oceanic si-
<lb n="51834"/>lence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing
<lb n="51835"/>waters.</p>
<p> <lb n="51836"/>A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft
<lb n="51837"/>long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and
<lb n="51838"/>flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in
<lb n="51839"/>mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry:@ and he
<lb n="51840"/>felt that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds
<lb n="51841"/>and in the pale space of sky above him had come forth from his
<lb n="51842"/>heart like a bird from a turret quietly and swiftly.</p>
<p> <lb n="51843"/>Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in
<lb n="51844"/>the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remember-
<lb n="51845"/>ing eyes the scene of the hall on the night of the opening of the
<lb n="51846"/>national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony,
<lb n="51847"/>looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls
<lb n="51848"/>and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the
<lb n="51849"/>garish lamps of the stage. A burly policeman sweated behind
<lb n="51850"/>him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls
<lb n="51851"/>and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall
<lb n="51852"/>from his scattered fellowstudents.
<lb n="51853"/><said who="???">--A libel on Ireland!</said>
<lb n="51854"/><said who="???">--Made in Germany!</said>
<lb n="51855"/><said who="???">--Blasphemy!</said>
<lb n="51856"/><said who="???">--We never sold our faith!</said>
<lb n="51857"/><said who="???">--No Irish woman ever did it!</said>
<lb n="51858"/><said who="???">--We want no amateur atheists.</said>
<lb n="51859"/><said who="???">--We want no budding buddhists.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51860"/>A sudden soft@ hiss fell from the windows above him and he
<lb n="51861"/>knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in the
<lb n="51862"/>readers' room. He turned into the pillared  hall, now calmly lit,
<lb n="51863"/>went up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turn-
<lb n="51864"/>stile.</p>
<p> <lb n="51865"/>Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book,
<lb n="51866"/>opened at the frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest.
<lb n="51867"/>He leaned back in his chair, inclining his ear like that of a
<lb n="51868"/>confessor to the face of the medical student who was reading to
<lb n="51869"/>him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat
<lb n="51870"/>down at his right and the priest at the other side of the  table
<lb n="51871"/>closed his copy of <emph>The Tablet</emph> with an angry snap and stood up.</p>
<p> <lb n="51872"/>Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical
<lb n="51873"/>student went on in a softer voice:
<lb n="51874"/><said who="???">--Pawn to king's fourth.</said>
<lb n="51875"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--We had better go, Dixon, said Stephen in warning. He has
<lb n="51876"/>gone to complain.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51877"/>Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying:
<lb n="51878"/><said who="???">--Our men retired in good order.</said>
<lb n="51879"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the title-
<lb n="51880"/>page of Cranly's book on which was printed <emph>Diseases of the
<lb n="51881"/>Ox</emph>.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51882"/>As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said:
<lb n="51883"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Cranly, I want to speak to you.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51884"/>Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the
<lb n="51885"/>counter and passed out, his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the
<lb n="51886"/>floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon
<lb n="51887"/>repeated:
<lb n="51888"/><said who="???">--Pawn to king's bloody fourth.</said>
<lb n="51889"/><said who="???">--Put it that way if you like, Dixon said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51890"/>He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a
<lb n="51891"/>finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a
<lb n="51892"/>signet ring.</p>
<p> <lb n="51893"/>As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came
<lb n="51894"/>towards them. Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven
<lb n="51895"/>face began to smile with pleasure and he was heard to murmur.
<lb n="51896"/>The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey.
<lb n="51897"/><said who="???">--Good evening, captain, said Cranly, halting.</said>
<lb n="51898"/><said who="???">--Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubblegrown monkeyish
<lb n="51899"/>face.</said>
<lb n="51900"/><said who="???">--Warm weather for March, said Cranly. They have the win-
<lb n="51901"/>dows open upstairs.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51902"/>Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish monkey-
<lb n="51903"/>puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure@
<lb n="51904"/>and its voice purred:
<lb n="51905"/><said who="???">--Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful.</said>
<lb n="51906"/><said who="???">--There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain, tired of
<lb n="51907"/>waiting, Dixon said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51908"/>Cranly smiled and said kindly:
<lb n="51909"/><said who="???">--The captain has only one love: sir Walter Scott. Isn't that so,
<lb n="51910"/>captain?</said>
<lb n="51911"/><said who="???">--What are you reading now, captain? Dixon asked. <emph>The Bride
<lb n="51912"/>of <place><location><geo>55.775902 -4.136255</geo></location><placeName>Lammermoor</placeName></place>?</emph></said>
<lb n="51913"/><said who="???">--I love old Scott, the flexible lips said. I think he writes some-
<lb n="51914"/>thing lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51915"/>He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in
<lb n="51916"/>time to his praise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his
<lb n="51917"/>sad eyes.</p>
<p> <lb n="51918"/>Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low
<lb n="51919"/>and moist, marred by errors: and listening to it he wondered
<lb n="51920"/>was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his
<lb n="51921"/>shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous  love?</p>
<p> <lb n="51922"/>The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and
<lb n="51923"/>ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield. A game of swans flew
<lb n="51924"/>there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with
<lb n="51925"/>their greenwhite slime. They embraced softly@ impelled by the
<lb n="51926"/>grey rainy light, the wet silent trees, the shieldlike witnessing
<lb n="51927"/>lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his
<lb n="51928"/>arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen cloak was wrapped
<lb n="51929"/>athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was
<lb n="51930"/>bent in willing shame. He had loose redbrown hair and tender
<lb n="51931"/>shapely strong freckled hands. Face?@ There was no face seen.
<lb n="51932"/>The brother's face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair.
<lb n="51933"/>The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was
<lb n="51934"/>Davin's hand.</p>
<p> <lb n="51935"/>He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled
<lb n="51936"/>mannikin who had called it forth. His father's gibes at the <place><location><geo>51.680080 -9.452576</geo></location>
<lb n="51937"/><placeName>Bantry</placeName></place> gang leaped out of his memory. He held them at a
<lb n="51938"/>distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought again. Why
<lb n="51939"/>were they not  Cranly's hands? Had Davin's simplicity and in-
<lb n="51940"/>nocence stung him more secretly?</p>
<p> <lb n="51941"/>He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to
<lb n="51942"/>take leave elaborately of the dwarf.</p>
<p> <lb n="51943"/>Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a
<lb n="51944"/>little group of students. One of them cried:
<lb n="51945"/><said who="???">--Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form.</p>
<p> <lb n="51946"/>Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes.</said>
<lb n="51947"/><said who="???">--You're a hypocrite, O'Keeffe, he said.@ And@ Dixon's a smiler.
<lb n="51948"/>By hell, I think that's a good literary expression.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51949"/>He laughed slily, looking in Stephen's face, repeating:
<lb n="51950"/><said who="???">--By hell, I'm delighted with that name. A smiler.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51951"/>A stout student who stood below them on the steps said:
<lb n="51952"/><said who="???">--Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear about
<lb n="51953"/>that.</said>
<lb n="51954"/><said who="???">--He had, faith, Temple said. And he was a married man too.
<lb n="51955"/>And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they
<lb n="51956"/>all had a touch.</said>
<lb n="51957"/><said who="???">--We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter, said Dixon.</said>
<lb n="51958"/><said who="???">--Tell us, Temple, O'Keeffe said.@ How@ many quarts of porter
<lb n="51959"/>have you in you?</said>
<lb n="51960"/><said who="???">--All your intellectual soul is in that phrase, O'Keeffe, said
<lb n="51961"/>Temple with open scorn.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51962"/>He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke
<lb n="51963"/>to Stephen.
<lb n="51964"/><said who="???">--Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? he
<lb n="51965"/>asked.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51966"/>Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his
<lb n="51967"/>hat thrust back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth
<lb n="51968"/>with care.
<lb n="51969"/><said who="???">--And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that
<lb n="51970"/>about the Forsters?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51971"/>He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from
<lb n="51972"/>his teeth on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it
<lb n="51973"/>intently.
<lb n="51974"/><said who="???">--The Forster  family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin
<lb n="51975"/>the First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. Forester
<lb n="51976"/>and Forster are the same name. A descendant of Baldwin the
<lb n="51977"/>First, captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland and married
<lb n="51978"/>the daughter of the last chieftain of Clanbrassil. Then there are
<lb n="51979"/>the Blake Forsters. That's a different branch.</said>
<lb n="51980"/><said who="???">--From Baldhead, king of Flanders, Cranly repeated, rooting
<lb n="51981"/>again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth.</said>
<lb n="51982"/><said who="???">--Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked.</said>
<lb n="51983"/><said who="???">--I know all the history of your family too, Temple said,
<lb n="51984"/>turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis
<lb n="51985"/>says about your family?</said>
<lb n="51986"/><said who="???">--Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive
<lb n="51987"/>student with dark eyes.</said>
<lb n="51988"/><said who="???">--Baldhead, Cranly repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth.</said>
<lb n="51989"/><said who="???">--<seg xml:lang="la">Pernobilis et pervetusta familia</seg>, Temple said to Stephen.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51990"/>The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted
<lb n="51991"/>briefly. Dixon turned towards him saying in a soft voice:
<lb n="51992"/><said who="???">--Did an angel speak?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="51993"/>Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger:
<lb n="51994"/><said who="???">--Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you
<lb n="51995"/>know.</said>
<lb n="51996"/><said who="???">--I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered firmly. It
<lb n="51997"/>did no-one@ any harm, did it?</said>
<lb n="51998"/><said who="???">--We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind
<lb n="51999"/>known to science as a <seg xml:lang="la">paulo post futurum</seg>.</said>
<lb n="52000"/><said who="???">--Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning right
<lb n="52001"/>and left. Didn't I give him that name?</said>
<lb n="52002"/><said who="???">--You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52003"/>Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then,
<lb n="52004"/>with a snort of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps.
<lb n="52005"/><said who="???">--Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot.
<lb n="52006"/>And you are a stinkpot.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52007"/>Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned
<lb n="52008"/>to his place with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen
<lb n="52009"/>and asked:
<lb n="52010"/><said who="???">--Do you believe in the law of heredity?</said>
<lb n="52011"/><said who="???">--Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to
<lb n="52012"/>say? asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of
<lb n="52013"/>wonder.</said>
<lb n="52014"/><said who="???">--The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said with
<lb n="52015"/>enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Repro-
<lb n="52016"/>duction is the beginning of death.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52017"/>He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly:
<lb n="52018"/><said who="???">--Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52019"/>Cranly pointed his long forefinger.
<lb n="52020"/><said who="???">--Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at
<lb n="52021"/>Ireland's hope!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52022"/>They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on
<lb n="52023"/>him bravely, saying:
<lb n="52024"/><said who="???">--Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I
<lb n="52025"/>am as good as you are@ any day. Do you know what I think
<lb n="52026"/>about you now as compared with myself?</said>
<lb n="52027"/><said who="???">--My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do
<lb n="52028"/>you know, absolutely incapable of thinking.</said>
<lb n="52029"/><said who="???">--But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you and
<lb n="52030"/>of myself compared together?</said>
<lb n="52031"/><said who="???">--Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the steps.
<lb n="52032"/>Get it out in bits!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52033"/>Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures
<lb n="52034"/>as he spoke.
<lb n="52035"/><said who="???">--I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am.
<lb n="52036"/>And I know I am. And I admit it that I am.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52037"/>Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly:
<lb n="52038"/><said who="???">--And it does you every credit, Temple.</said>
<lb n="52039"/><said who="???">--But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly. He is a ballocks too
<lb n="52040"/>like me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference
<lb n="52041"/>I see.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52042"/>A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again
<lb n="52043"/>to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness:
<lb n="52044"/><said who="???">--That word is a most interesting word. That's the only Eng-
<lb n="52045"/>lish dual number. Did you know?</said>
<lb n="52046"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Is it? Stephen said vaguely.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52047"/>He was watching Cranly's firmfeatured suffering face, lit up
<lb n="52048"/>now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed
<lb n="52049"/>over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient
<lb n="52050"/>of injuries: and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in
<lb n="52051"/>salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly from his
<lb n="52052"/>forehead like an iron crown.</p>
<p> <lb n="52053"/>She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed
<lb n="52054"/>across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there
<lb n="52055"/>not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at
<lb n="52056"/>Temple's words? The light had waned. He could not see.</p>
<p> <lb n="52057"/>Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh com-
<lb n="52058"/>ments, the sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had
<lb n="52059"/>shattered so often Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Ste-
<lb n="52060"/>phen had forgiven freely for he had found this rudeness also in
<lb n="52061"/>himself towards himself. And he remembered an evening when
<lb n="52062"/>he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray
<lb n="52063"/>to God in a wood near <place><location><geo>53.450924 -6.150138</geo></location><placeName>Malahide</placeName></place>. He had lifted up his arms
<lb n="52064"/>and spoken in ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing
<lb n="52065"/>that he stood on holy ground and in a holy hour. And when
<lb n="52066"/>two constabularymen had come into sight round a bend in the
<lb n="52067"/>gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an
<lb n="52068"/>air from the last pantomime.</p>
<p> <lb n="52069"/>He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the
<lb n="52070"/>base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait.
<lb n="52071"/>The talk about him ceased for a moment: and a soft hiss fell
<lb n="52072"/>again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air
<lb n="52073"/>and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes
<lb n="52074"/>were sleeping.</p>
<p> <lb n="52075"/>She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was
<lb n="52076"/>silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues
<lb n="52077"/>about him had ceased their babble. Darkness  was falling.</p>
<p> <lb n="52078"/><l><emph>Darkness falls from the air.</emph></l>
<p> <lb n="52079"/>A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy
<lb n="52080"/>host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening
<lb n="52081"/>air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound,
<lb n="52082"/>rich and lutelike?</p>
<p> <lb n="52083"/>He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the
<lb n="52084"/>end of the colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to
<lb n="52085"/>hide his revery from the students whom he had left: and
<lb n="52086"/>allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland
<lb n="52087"/>and Byrd and Nash.</p>
<p> <lb n="52088"/>Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed
<lb n="52089"/>the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the soft-
<lb n="52090"/>ness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the
<lb n="52091"/>shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a
<lb n="52092"/>slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory
<lb n="52093"/>ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan:
<lb n="52094"/>and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in <place><location><geo>51.511732 -0.123270</geo></location><placeName>Covent
<lb n="52095"/>Garden</placeName></place> wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and
<lb n="52096"/>the poxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that,
<lb n="52097"/>gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</p>
<p> <lb n="52098"/>The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They
<lb n="52099"/>were secret and enflaming but her image was not entangled by
<lb n="52100"/>them. That was not the way to think of her. It was not even the
<lb n="52101"/>way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then not trust
<lb n="52102"/>itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like
<lb n="52103"/>the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth.</p>
<p> <lb n="52104"/>It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that
<lb n="52105"/>her figure was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely
<lb n="52106"/>first and then more sharply he smelt her body. A conscious
<lb n="52107"/>unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body that@ he smelt:
<lb n="52108"/>a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music
<lb n="52109"/>had flowed desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her
<lb n="52110"/>flesh distilled odour and a dew.</p>
<p> <lb n="52111"/>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his
<lb n="52112"/>thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught
<lb n="52113"/>it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, be-
<lb n="52114"/>tween thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from
<lb n="52115"/>him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind
<lb n="52116"/>a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the
<lb n="52117"/>lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the
<lb n="52118"/>other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of
<lb n="52119"/>his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body,
<lb n="52120"/>illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sud-
<lb n="52121"/>den spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle
<lb n="52122"/>bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as
<lb n="52123"/>they fell. Yes:@ and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It
<lb n="52124"/>was brightness.</p>
<p> <lb n="52125"/><l><emph>Brightness falls from the air.</emph></l>
<p> <lb n="52126"/>He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the
<lb n="52127"/>images it  had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His
<lb n="52128"/>thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth.</p>
<p> <lb n="52129"/>He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the
<lb n="52130"/>group of students. Well then@ let her go and be damned to her.
<lb n="52131"/>She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every
<lb n="52132"/>morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.</p>
<p> <lb n="52133"/>Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his
<lb n="52134"/>pocket and was eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the
<lb n="52135"/>pediment of a pillar, leaning back, his cap pulled down on his
<lb n="52136"/>sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the porch, a
<lb n="52137"/>leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards
<lb n="52138"/>the group, striking the flags with the heels of his boots and
<lb n="52139"/>with the ferrule@ of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising the um-
<lb n="52140"/>brella in salute, he said to all:
<lb n="52141"/><said who="???">--Good evening, sirs.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52142"/>He struck the flags again and tittered while his head
<lb n="52143"/>trembled with a slight nervous movement. The tall consump-
<lb n="52144"/>tive student and Dixon and O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and
<lb n="52145"/>did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said:
<lb n="52146"/><said who="???">--Good evening, particularly to you.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52147"/>He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again.
<lb n="52148"/>Cranly, who was still chewing the fig, answered with loud
<lb n="52149"/>movements of his jaws.
<lb n="52150"/><said who="???">--Good? Yes. It is a good evening.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52151"/>The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his
<lb n="52152"/>umbrella gently and reprovingly.
<lb n="52153"/><said who="???">--I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious
<lb n="52154"/>remarks.</said>
<lb n="52155"/><said who="???">--Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the
<lb n="52156"/>halfchewed fig and jerking it towards the squat student's
<lb n="52157"/>mouth in sign that he should eat.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52158"/>The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his  special
<lb n="52159"/>humour, said gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase
<lb n="52160"/>with his  umbrella:
<lb n="52161"/><said who="???">--Do you intend that ...</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52162"/>He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig
<lb n="52163"/>and said loudly:
<lb n="52164"/><said who="???">--I allude to that.</said>
<lb n="52165"/><said who="???">--Um, Cranly said as before.</said>
<lb n="52166"/><said who="???">--Do you intend that now, the squat student said, as <emph>ipso@ facto</emph>
<lb n="52167"/>or, let us say, as so to speak?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52168"/>Dixon turned aside from his group, saying:
<lb n="52169"/><said who="???">--Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to
<lb n="52170"/>the Adelphi to look for you and Moynihan. What have you
<lb n="52171"/>there? he asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn's arm.</said>
<p> <lb n="52172"/><said who="???">--Examination papers, Glynn answered. I give them monthly
<lb n="52173"/>examinations to see that they are profiting by my tuition.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52174"/>He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled.
<lb n="52175"/><said who="???">--Tuition! said Cranly rudely. I suppose you mean the bare-
<lb n="52176"/>footed children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God
<lb n="52177"/>help them!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52178"/>He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt.
<lb n="52179"/><said who="???">--I suffer little children to come unto me, Glynn said amiably.</said>
<lb n="52180"/><said who="???">--A bloody ape, Cranly repeated with emphasis, and a blas-
<lb n="52181"/>phemous bloody ape!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52182"/>Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed
<lb n="52183"/>Glynn:
<lb n="52184"/><said who="???">--That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testa-
<lb n="52185"/>ment about suffer the children to come to me.</said>
<lb n="52186"/><said who="???">--Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe.</said>
<lb n="52187"/><said who="???">--Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn,
<lb n="52188"/>and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church
<lb n="52189"/>send them all to hell if they die unbaptised? Why is that?</said>
<lb n="52190"/><said who="???">--Were you baptised yourself, Temple? the consumptive stu-
<lb n="52191"/>dent asked.</said>
<lb n="52192"/><said who="???">--But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to
<lb n="52193"/>come? Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn's eyes.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52194"/>Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty
<lb n="52195"/>the nervous titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every
<lb n="52196"/>word:
<lb n="52197"/><said who="???">--And, as you remark, if it is thus I ask emphatically whence
<lb n="52198"/>comes this thusness.</said>
<lb n="52199"/><said who="???">--Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple said.</said>
<lb n="52200"/><said who="???">--Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon said
<lb n="52201"/>suavely.</said>
<lb n="52202"/><said who="???">--Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children going to
<lb n="52203"/>hell, Temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too.</said>
<lb n="52204"/><said who="???">--I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that
<lb n="52205"/>limbo existed for such cases.</said>
<lb n="52206"/><said who="???">--Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't
<lb n="52207"/>talk to him or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the
<lb n="52208"/>way you'd lead a bleating goat.</said>
<lb n="52209"/><said who="???">--Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like hell.</said>
<lb n="52210"/><said who="???">--But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said.</said>
<p> <lb n="52211"/>He turned smiling to the others and said:
<lb n="52212"/><said who="???">--I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so
<lb n="52213"/>much.</said>
<lb n="52214"/><said who="???">--You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland is
<lb n="52215"/>united.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52216"/>He struck the ferrule@ of his umbrella on the stone floor of
<lb n="52217"/>the colonnade.
<lb n="52218"/><said who="???">--Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the grey
<lb n="52219"/>spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans,
<lb n="52220"/>strong and ugly. But what is limbo?</said>
<lb n="52221"/><said who="???">--Put him back into  the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe called
<lb n="52222"/>out.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52223"/>Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping
<lb n="52224"/>his foot@ and@ crying as if to a fowl:
<lb n="52225"/><said who="Cranly">--Hoosh!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52226"/>Temple moved away nimbly.
<lb n="52227"/><said who="Temple">--Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what
<lb n="52228"/>we call a notion like that in Roscommon?</said>
<lb n="52229"/><said who="Cranly">--Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands.</said>
<lb n="52230"/><said who="Temple">--Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully.
<lb n="52231"/>And that's what I call limbo.</said>
<lb n="52232"/><said who="Cranly">--Give us that stick here, Cranly said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52233"/>He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and
<lb n="52234"/>sprang down the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pur-
<lb n="52235"/>suit, fled through the dusk like a wild creature, nimble and
<lb n="52236"/>fleetfooted. Cranly's heavy boots were heard loudly charging
<lb n="52237"/>across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and
<lb n="52238"/>spurning the gravel at each step.</p>
<p> <lb n="52239"/>His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he
<lb n="52240"/>thrust the stick back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his
<lb n="52241"/>anger had another cause but, feigning patience, touched his
<lb n="52242"/>arm slightly and said quietly:
<p> <lb n="52243"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52244"/>Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:
<lb n="52245"/><said who="???">--Now?</said>
<lb n="52246"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52247"/>They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The
<lb n="52248"/>birdcall from <emph>Siegfried</emph>@ whistled softly followed them from the
<lb n="52249"/>steps of the porch. Cranly turned: and Dixon, who had
<lb n="52250"/>whistled, called out:
<lb n="52251"/><said who="???">--Where are you fellows off to? What about that  game,
<lb n="52252"/>Cranly?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52253"/>They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of
<lb n="52254"/>billiards to be played in the <place><location><geo>53.350570 -6.254002</geo></location><placeName>Adelphi hotel</placeName></place>. Stephen walked on
<lb n="52255"/>alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street. Opposite
<lb n="52256"/>Maple's hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The name of the
<lb n="52257"/>hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front
<lb n="52258"/>stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back
<lb n="52259"/>at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined
<lb n="52260"/>the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They
<lb n="52261"/>thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants greeted
<lb n="52262"/>them along the roads  in the country: they knew the names of
<lb n="52263"/>certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched
<lb n="52264"/>provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents.</p>
<p> <lb n="52265"/>How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow
<lb n="52266"/>over the imagination@ of their daughters, before their squires
<lb n="52267"/>begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than
<lb n="52268"/>their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts
<lb n="52269"/>and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats@
<lb n="52270"/>across the dark country lanes,  under trees by the edges of
<lb n="52271"/>streams and near the poolmottled bogs. A woman had waited
<lb n="52272"/>in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering
<lb n="52273"/>him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed:@ for Davin
<lb n="52274"/>had the mild eyes of one that@ could be secret. But him no
<lb n="52275"/>woman's eyes had wooed.</p>
<p> <lb n="52276"/>His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said:
<lb n="52277"/><said who="???">--Let us eke go.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52278"/>They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said:
<lb n="52279"/><said who="???">--That blithering idiot Temple! I swear to Moses, do you
<lb n="52280"/>know, that I'll be the death of that fellow one time.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52281"/>But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered
<lb n="52282"/>was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch.</p>
<p> <lb n="52283"/>They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they
<lb n="52284"/>had gone on so for some time Stephen said:
<lb n="52285"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.</said>
<lb n="52286"/><said who="???">--With your people? Cranly asked.</said>
<lb n="52287"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--With my mother.</said>
<lb n="52288"/><said who="???">--About religion?</said>
<lb n="52289"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, Stephen answered.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52290"/>After a pause Cranly asked:
<lb n="52291"/><said who="???">--What age is your mother?</said>
<lb n="52292"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter
<lb n="52293"/>duty.</said>
<lb n="52294"/><said who="???">--And will you?</said>
<lb n="52295"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I will not, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52296"/><said who="???">--Why not? Cranly said.</said>
<lb n="52297"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I will not serve, answered Stephen.</said>
<lb n="52298"/><said who="???">--That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly.</said>
<lb n="52299"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52300"/>Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying:
<lb n="52301"/><said who="???">--Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do
<lb n="52302"/>you know.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52303"/>He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Ste-
<lb n="52304"/>phen's face with moved and friendly eyes, said:
<lb n="52305"/><said who="???">--Do you know that you are an excitable man?</said>
<lb n="52306"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52307"/>Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been
<lb n="52308"/>drawn closer, one to the other.
<lb n="52309"/><said who="???">--Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked.</said>
<lb n="52310"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I do not, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52311"/><said who="???">--Do you disbelieve then?</said>
<lb n="52312"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered.</said>
<lb n="52313"/><said who="???">--Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they
<lb n="52314"/>overcome them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your
<lb n="52315"/>doubts on that point too strong?</said>
<lb n="52316"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52317"/>Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from
<lb n="52318"/>his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said:
<lb n="52319"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your
<lb n="52320"/>mouth full of chewed  fig.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52321"/>Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which
<lb n="52322"/>he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece,
<lb n="52323"/>spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter. Addressing
<lb n="52324"/>it as it lay, he said:
<lb n="52325"/><said who="???">--Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52326"/>Taking Stephen's arm@ he went on again and said:
<lb n="52327"/><said who="???">--Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on
<lb n="52328"/>the day of judgment?</said>
<lb n="52329"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. An
<lb n="52330"/>eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies?</said>
<lb n="52331"/><said who="???">--Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified.</said>
<lb n="52332"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly.@ Bright,@ agile, impassible
<lb n="52333"/>and, above all, subtle.</said>
<lb n="52334"/><said who="???">--It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassion-
<lb n="52335"/>ately, how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in
<lb n="52336"/>which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you
<lb n="52337"/>were at school? I bet you did.</said>
<lb n="52338"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I did, Stephen answered.</said>
<lb n="52339"/><said who="???">--And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly. Happier
<lb n="52340"/>than you are now, for instance?</said>
<lb n="52341"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was some-
<lb n="52342"/>one else then.</said>
<lb n="52343"/><said who="???">--How someone else? What do you mean by that  statement?</said>
<lb n="52344"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I
<lb n="52345"/>had to become.</said>
<lb n="52346"/><said who="???">--Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly
<lb n="52347"/>repeated. Let me ask you a question. Do you love your mother?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52348"/>Stephen shook his head slowly.
<lb n="52349"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I don't know what your words mean, he said simply.</said>
<lb n="52350"/><said who="???">--Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked.</said>
<lb n="52351"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Do you mean women?</said>
<lb n="52352"/><said who="???">--I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I ask
<lb n="52353"/>you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52354"/>Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the
<lb n="52355"/>footpath.
<lb n="52356"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I failed. It
<lb n="52357"/>is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will of God
<lb n="52358"/>instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps
<lb n="52359"/>do that still .....@</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52360"/>Cranly cut him short by asking:
<lb n="52361"/><said who="???">--Has your mother had a happy life?</said>
<lb n="52362"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--How do I know? Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52363"/><said who="???">--How many children had she?</said>
<lb n="52364"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died.</said>
<lb n="52365"/><said who="???">--Was your father .... Cranly interrupted himself for an in-
<lb n="52366"/>stant: and then said: I don't want to pry  into your family
<lb n="52367"/>affairs. But was your father what is called  well-to-do? I mean
<lb n="52368"/>when you were growing up?</said>
<lb n="52369"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52370"/><said who="???">--What was he? Cranly asked after a pause.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52371"/>Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes.
<p> <lb n="52372"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a
<lb n="52373"/>shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a
<lb n="52374"/>drinker, a good fellow, a storyteller, somebody's secretary,
<lb n="52375"/>something in a distillery, a taxgatherer, a bankrupt and at
<lb n="52376"/>present a praiser of his own past.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52377"/>Cranly laughed, tightening  his grip on Stephen's arm, and
<lb n="52378"/>said:
<lb n="52379"/><said who="???">--The distillery is damn good.</said>
<lb n="52380"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked.</said>
<lb n="52381"/><said who="???">--Are you in good circumstances at present?</said>
<lb n="52382"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly.</said>
<lb n="52383"/><said who="???">--So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap
<lb n="52384"/>of luxury.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52385"/>He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used
<lb n="52386"/>technical expressions as if he wished his hearer to understand
<lb n="52387"/>that they were used by him without conviction.
<lb n="52388"/><said who="???">--Your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffer-
<lb n="52389"/>ing, he said then. Would you not try to save her from suffering
<lb n="52390"/>more even if ....@ or would you?</said>
<lb n="52391"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--If I could, Stephen said. That would cost me very little.</said>
<lb n="52392"/><said who="???">--Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. What
<lb n="52393"/>is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And
<lb n="52394"/>you will set her mind at rest.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52395"/>He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent.
<lb n="52396"/>Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought,
<lb n="52397"/>he said:
<lb n="52398"/><said who="???">--Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a
<lb n="52399"/>mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world,
<lb n="52400"/>carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she
<lb n="52401"/>feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must
<lb n="52402"/>be. What are our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that
<lb n="52403"/>bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too.
<lb n="52404"/>Every jackass going the  roads thinks he has ideas.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52405"/>Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech
<lb n="52406"/>behind the words, said with  assumed carelessness:
<p> <lb n="52407"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to
<lb n="52408"/>kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex.</said>
<lb n="52409"/><said who="???">--Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.</said>
<lb n="52410"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen
<lb n="52411"/>said.</said>
<lb n="52412"/><said who="???">--And he was another pig then, said Cranly.</said>
<lb n="52413"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected.</said>
<lb n="52414"/><said who="???">--I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly
<lb n="52415"/>said rudely and flatly. I call him a pig.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52416"/>Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued:
<lb n="52417"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Jesus@ too@ seems to have treated his mother with scant cour-
<lb n="52418"/>tesy in public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish
<lb n="52419"/>gentleman, has apologised for him.</said>
<lb n="52420"/><said who="???">--Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was
<lb n="52421"/>not what he pretended to be?</said>
<lb n="52422"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The first person to whom that idea occurred,  Stephen
<lb n="52423"/>answered, was Jesus himself.</said>
<lb n="52424"/><said who="???">--I mean, Cranly said,  hardening in his speech, did the idea
<lb n="52425"/>ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite,
<lb n="52426"/>what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to
<lb n="52427"/>put it more plainly, that he was a blackguard?</said>
<lb n="52428"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--That idea never occurred  to me, Stephen answered. But I am
<lb n="52429"/>curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a
<lb n="52430"/>pervert of yourself?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52431"/>He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw
<lb n="52432"/>smile which some force of will strove to make finely significant.</p>
<p> <lb n="52433"/>Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone:
<lb n="52434"/><said who="???">--Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said?</said>
<lb n="52435"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Somewhat, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52436"/><said who="???">--And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same
<lb n="52437"/>tone, if you feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus
<lb n="52438"/>was not the son of God?</said>
<lb n="52439"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a son
<lb n="52440"/>of God than a son of Mary.</said>
<lb n="52441"/><said who="???">--And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked,
<lb n="52442"/>because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the
<lb n="52443"/>host too may be the body and blood of the son of God and not
<lb n="52444"/>a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be?</said>
<lb n="52445"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, Stephen said quietly. I feel that and I also fear it.</said>
<lb n="52446"/><said who="???">--I see, Cranly said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52447"/>Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the dis-
<lb n="52448"/>cussion at once by saying:
<lb n="52449"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I fear many things: dogs, horses, firearms, the sea, thunder-
<lb n="52450"/>storms, machinery, the country roads at night.</said>
<lb n="52451"/><said who="???">--But why do you fear a bit of bread?</said>
<lb n="52452"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent  reality
<lb n="52453"/>behind those things I say I fear.</said>
<lb n="52454"/><said who="???">--Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman
<lb n="52455"/>catholics would strike you dead and damn you if you made a
<lb n="52456"/>sacrilegious communion?</said>
<lb n="52457"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen
<lb n="52458"/>said. I fear more than that the chemical action which would be
<lb n="52459"/>set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which
<lb n="52460"/>are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration.</said>
<lb n="52461"/><said who="???">--Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger commit that
<lb n="52462"/>particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?</said>
<lb n="52463"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not.</said>
<lb n="52464"/><said who="???">--Then, said Cranly, you do not intend to become a protes-
<lb n="52465"/>tant?</said>
<lb n="52466"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I said that I had lost the faith, Stephen answered, but not
<lb n="52467"/>that I had lost selfrespect. What kind of liberation would that
<lb n="52468"/>be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to
<lb n="52469"/>embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52470"/>They had walked on towards the township of <place><location><geo>51.873620 -8.347738</geo></location><placeName>Pembroke</placeName></place> and
<lb n="52471"/>now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and
<lb n="52472"/>the scattered lights in the villas soothed their minds. The air of
<lb n="52473"/>wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their
<lb n="52474"/>neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the
<lb n="52475"/>window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard
<lb n="52476"/>singing as she sharpened knives. She sang@ in short broken bars@
<lb n="52477"/><emph>Rosie O'Grady</emph>.</p>
<p> <lb n="52478"/>Cranly stopped to listen, saying:
<lb n="52479"/><said who="???">--<seg xml:lang="la">Mulier cantat.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="52480"/>The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchant-
<lb n="52481"/>ing touch the  dark of the evening, with a touch fainter and
<lb n="52482"/>more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's
<lb n="52483"/>hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of
<lb n="52484"/>woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed si-
<lb n="52485"/>lently through the darkness: a whiterobed figure, small and
<lb n="52486"/>slender as a boy and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and
<lb n="52487"/>high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the
<lb n="52488"/>first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of
<lb n="52489"/>the first chanting of the passion:
<lb n="52490"/><said who="???">--<seg xml:lang="la">Et tu cum Jesu Galilaeo@ eras.</seg></said></p>
<p> <lb n="52491"/>And all  hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining
<lb n="52492"/>like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the pro-
<lb n="52493"/>paroxyton and more faintly as the cadence died.</p>
<p> <lb n="52494"/>The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating
<lb n="52495"/>in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain:
<lg>
<lb n="52496"/><l>And when we are married</l>
<lb n="52497"/><l>O, how happy we'll be</l>
<lb n="52498"/><l>For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady</l>
<lb n="52499"/><l>And Rosie O'Grady loves me.</l>
</lg>
<lb n="52500"/><said who="???">--There's real poetry for you, he said. There's real love.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52501"/>He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and
<lb n="52502"/>said:
<lb n="52503"/><said who="???">--Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the
<lb n="52504"/>words mean?</said>
<lb n="52505"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I want to see Rosie first, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="52506"/><said who="???">--She's easy to find, Cranly said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52507"/>His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back:
<lb n="52508"/>and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face,
<lb n="52509"/>framed by the dark, and his large dark eyes. Yes. His face was
<lb n="52510"/>handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken
<lb n="52511"/>of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the
<lb n="52512"/>weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them
<lb n="52513"/>with a strong  and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.</p>
<p> <lb n="52514"/>Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's
<lb n="52515"/>lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship
<lb n="52516"/>was coming to an end. Yes:@ he would go. He could not strive
<lb n="52517"/>against another. He knew his part.
<lb n="52518"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Probably I shall go away, he said.</said>
<lb n="52519"/><said who="???">--Where? Cranly asked.</said>
<lb n="52520"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Where I can, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52521"/><said who="???">--Yes, Cranly said. It might be difficult for you to live here
<lb n="52522"/>now. But is it that that makes you go?</said>
<lb n="52523"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I have to go, Stephen answered.</p>
<lb n="52524"/><said who="???">--Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself
<lb n="52525"/>as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an
<lb n="52526"/>outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do.
<lb n="52527"/>Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building
<lb n="52528"/>nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of
<lb n="52529"/>those born into it. I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is
<lb n="52530"/>it what you told me the night we were standing outside <place><location><geo>53.333446 -6.262433</geo></location><placeName>Har-
<lb n="52531"/>court Street station@</placeName></place>?</said>
<lb n="52532"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way
<lb n="52533"/>of remembering thoughts in connection with places. The night
<lb n="52534"/>you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the
<lb n="52535"/>shortest way from <place><location><geo>53.136900 -6.310000</geo></location><placeName>Sallygap</placeName></place> to Larras.</said>
<lb n="52536"/><said who="???">--Pothead! Cranly said with calm contempt. What does he
<lb n="52537"/>know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he
<lb n="52538"/>know about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering
<lb n="52539"/>washingpot head of him!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52540"/>He broke out into a loud long laugh.
<lb n="52541"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Well? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?</said>
<lb n="52542"/><said who="???">--What you said, is it? Cranly asked. Yes, I remember it. To
<lb n="52543"/>discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could
<lb n="52544"/>express itself in unfettered freedom.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52545"/>Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgment.
<lb n="52546"/><said who="???">--Freedom! Cranly repeated. But you are not free enough yet
<lb n="52547"/>to commit a sacrilege. Tell me, would you rob?</said>
<lb n="52548"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I would beg first, Stephen said.</said>
<lb n="52549"/><said who="???">--And if you got  nothing@ would you rob?</said>
<lb n="52550"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of
<lb n="52551"/>property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is
<lb n="52552"/>not unlawful to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will
<lb n="52553"/>not make you that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian Juan
<lb n="52554"/>Mariana de Talavera who will also explain to you in what
<lb n="52555"/>circumstances you may lawfully kill your king and whether you
<lb n="52556"/>had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him
<lb n="52557"/>upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer
<lb n="52558"/>others to rob me or, if they did, would I call down upon them
<lb n="52559"/>what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm.</said>
<lb n="52560"/><said who="???">--And would you?</said>
<lb n="52561"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I think, Stephen said, it would pain me as much to do so as
<lb n="52562"/>to be robbed.</said>
<lb n="52563"/><said who="???">--I see, Cranly said.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52564"/>He produced his match and began to clean the crevice be-
<lb n="52565"/>tween two teeth. Then he said carelessly:
<lb n="52566"/><said who="???">--Tell me, for example, would you deflower a virgin?</said>
<lb n="52567"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Excuse me, Stephen said politely.@ Is@ that not the ambition of
<lb n="52568"/>most young gentlemen?</said>
<lb n="52569"/><said who="???">--What then is your point of view? Cranly asked.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52570"/>His last phrase, soursmelling as the smoke of charcoal and
<lb n="52571"/>disheartening, excited Stephen's brain@ over which its fumes
<lb n="52572"/>seemed to brood.
<lb n="52573"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would
<lb n="52574"/>do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and
<lb n="52575"/>what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer
<lb n="52576"/>believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my
<lb n="52577"/>church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or
<lb n="52578"/>art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my
<lb n="52579"/>defence the only arms I allow myself to use,@ -@ silence, exile@ and
<lb n="52580"/>cunning.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52581"/>Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead@
<lb n="52582"/>him back towards <place><location><geo>53.328562 -6.251897</geo></location><placeName>Leeson Park</placeName></place>. He laughed almost slily and
<lb n="52583"/>pressed Stephen's arm with an elder's affection.
<lb n="52584"/><said who="???">--Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!</said>
<lb n="52585"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--And you made me confess to you, Stephen said, thrilled by
<lb n="52586"/>his touch, as I have confessed to you so  many other things,
<lb n="52587"/>have I not?</said>
<lb n="52588"/><said who="???">--Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.</said>
<lb n="52589"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you
<lb n="52590"/>also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be
<lb n="52591"/>spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I
<lb n="52592"/>am not afraid to make a mistake, even  a great  mistake, a
<lb n="52593"/>lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52594"/>Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said:
<lb n="52595"/><said who="???">--Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you know
<lb n="52596"/>what that word means? Not only to be separate from all others
<lb n="52597"/>but to have not even one friend.</said>
<p> <lb n="52598"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I will take the risk, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="52599"/><said who="???">--And not to have any one person, Cranly said, who would be
<lb n="52600"/>more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest
<lb n="52601"/>friend a man ever had.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52602"/>His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his
<lb n="52603"/>own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or
<lb n="52604"/>wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in
<lb n="52605"/>silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of

</div> <!-- 5.3 --> <div n="5.4" type="section">
<p> <lb n="52609"/><emph>20 March:</emph>@ Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my re-
<lb n="52610"/>volt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked
<lb n="52611"/>me on the score of love for one's mother. Tried to imagine his
<lb n="52612"/>mother: cannot. Told me once, in a moment of thoughtlessness,
<lb n="52613"/>his father was sixtyone when he was born. Can see him. Strong
<lb n="52614"/>farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt
<lb n="52615"/>grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing matches. Pays his
<lb n="52616"/>dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras.
<lb n="52617"/>Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall. But his mother? Very
<lb n="52618"/>young or very old? Hardly the first. If so, Cranly would not
<lb n="52619"/>have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably:@ and neglected.
<lb n="52620"/>Hence Cranly's despair of soul: the child of exhausted loins.</p>
<p> <lb n="52621"/><emph>21 March, morning:</emph>@ Thought this in bed last night but was
<lb n="52622"/>too lazy and free to add it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are
<lb n="52623"/>those of Elizabeth@ and Zachary. Then is@ he [is]@ the precursor. Item:
<lb n="52624"/>he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild
<lb n="52625"/>honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed
<lb n="52626"/>head or deathmask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica.
<lb n="52627"/>Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled for the moment by
<lb n="52628"/>saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see? A decollated
<lb n="52629"/>precursor trying to pick the lock.</p>
<p> <lb n="52630"/><emph>21 March, night:</emph>@ Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the dead
<lb n="52631"/>bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead.</p>
<p> <lb n="52632"/><emph>22 March:</emph>@ In company with Lynch followed a sizable hos-
<lb n="52633"/>pital nurse. Lynch's idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry grey-
<lb n="52634"/>hounds walking after a heifer.</p>
<p> <lb n="52635"/><emph>23 March:</emph>@ Have not seen her since that night. Unwell? Sits at
<lb n="52636"/>the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But not
<lb n="52637"/>peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now?</p>
<p> <lb n="52638"/><emph>24 March:</emph>@ Began with a discussion with my mother. Subject:
<lb n="52639"/>B. V. M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape held up
<lb n="52640"/>relations between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary
<lb n="52641"/>and her son. Said religion is@ not a lying-in hospital. Mother
<lb n="52642"/>indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much.
<lb n="52643"/>Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I
<lb n="52644"/>would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This
<lb n="52645"/>means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through
<lb n="52646"/>the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent. Told her so and
<lb n="52647"/>asked for sixpence. Got threepence.</p>
<p> <lb n="52648"/>Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead
<lb n="52649"/>rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in
<lb n="52650"/>Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a ter-
<lb n="52651"/>rible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this
<lb n="52652"/>with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls
<lb n="52653"/><emph>risotto alla bergamasca</emph>. When he pronounces a soft <emph>o</emph> he pro-
<lb n="52654"/>trudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And
<lb n="52655"/>could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's
<lb n="52656"/>tears, one from each eye.</p>
<p> <lb n="52657"/>Crossing Stephen's, that is, <place><location><geo>53.338174 -6.259119</geo></location><placeName>my green</placeName></place>, remembered that his
<lb n="52658"/>countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other
<lb n="52659"/>night called our religion. A quartet of them, soldiers  of the
<lb n="52660"/>ninetyseventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and
<lb n="52661"/>tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified.</p>
<p> <lb n="52662"/>Went to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is
<lb n="52663"/>not out yet. Am I alarmed? About what? That she will never be
<lb n="52664"/>out again. Blake wrote:</p>
<lg>
<lb n="52665"/><l><emph>I wonder if William Bond will die.</emph>@</l>
<lb n="52666"/><l><emph>For assuredly he is very ill.</emph></l>
</lg>
<p> <lb n="52667"/>Alas, poor William!</p>
<p> <lb n="52668"/>I was once at a diorama in <place><location><geo>53.353368 -6.262135</geo></location><placeName>Rotunda</placeName></place>. At the end were pic-
<lb n="52669"/>tures of big nobs. Among them William Ewart Gladstone, just
<lb n="52670"/>then dead. Orchestra played <emph>O Willie, we have missed you</emph>.</p>@
<p> <lb n="52671"/>A race of clodhoppers.</p>@
<p> <lb n="52672"/><emph>25 March, morning:</emph>@ A troubled night of dreams. Want to get
<lb n="52673"/>them off my chest.</p>
<p> <lb n="52674"/>A long curving gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of dark
<lb n="52675"/>vapours. It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in
<lb n="52676"/>stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees in token of
<lb n="52677"/>weariness and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go
<lb n="52678"/>up before them for ever as dark vapours.</p>
<p> <lb n="52679"/>Strange figures advance from a cave. They are not as tall as
<lb n="52680"/>men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another.
<lb n="52681"/>Their faces are phosphorescent, with darker streaks. They peer
<lb n="52682"/>at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not
<lb n="52683"/>speak.</p>
<p> <lb n="52684"/><emph>30 March:</emph>@ This evening Cranly was in the porch of the
<lb n="52685"/>library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A
<lb n="52686"/>mother let her child fall into the Nile. Still harping on the
<lb n="52687"/>mother. A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back.
<lb n="52688"/>Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do
<lb n="52689"/>with the child, eat it or not eat it.</p>
<p> <lb n="52690"/>This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of
<lb n="52691"/>your mud by the operation of your sun.</p>
<p> <lb n="52692"/>And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nilemud with it!</p>
<p> <lb n="52693"/><emph>1 April:</emph>@ Disapprove of this last phrase.</p>
<p> <lb n="52694"/><emph>2 April:</emph>@ Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston,
<lb n="52695"/>Mooney and O'Brien's. Rather, lynxeyed Lynch saw her as we
<lb n="52696"/>passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he
<lb n="52697"/>bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I dis-
<lb n="52698"/>covered him. I protest I did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of <place><location><geo>52.979861 -6.048263</geo></location>
<lb n="52699"/><placeName>Wicklow</placeName></place> bran.</p>
<p> <lb n="52700"/><emph>3 April:</emph>@ Met Davin at the <place><location><geo>53.353437 -6.261749</geo></location><placeName>cigar shop opposite Findlater's
<lb n="52701"/>church</placeName></place>. He was in a black sweater and had a hurleystick.
<lb n="52702"/>Asked me was it true I was going away and why. Told him the
<lb n="52703"/>shortest way to <place><location><geo>53.412910 -8.243890</geo></location><placeName>Tara</placeName></place> was
<place><location><geo>53.309441 -4.633038</geo></location><placeName>Holyhead</placeName></place>. Just then my father
<lb n="52704"/>came up. Introduction. Father@ polite and observant. Asked
<lb n="52705"/>Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could
<lb n="52706"/>not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told
<lb n="52707"/>me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a
<lb n="52708"/>rowing club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he
<lb n="52709"/>broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was
<lb n="52710"/>cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p>
<p> <lb n="52711"/><emph>5 April:</emph>@ Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark stream of
<lb n="52712"/>swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their
<lb n="52713"/>delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure
<lb n="52714"/>and romping. All fair or auburn: no dark ones. They blush
<lb n="52715"/>better. Houp-la!</p>
<p> <lb n="52716"/><emph>6 April:</emph>@ Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all
<lb n="52717"/>women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood &ndash;
<lb n="52718"/>and mine if I was ever a child. The past is consumed in the
<lb n="52719"/>present and the present is living only because it brings forth the
<lb n="52720"/>future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be
<lb n="52721"/>fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her
<lb n="52722"/>own hinder parts.</p>
<p> <lb n="52723"/><emph>6 April: later:</emph>@ Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty
<lb n="52724"/>and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the
<lb n="52725"/>loveliness which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not
<lb n="52726"/>at all. I desire to press in my arms the loveliness which has not
<lb n="52727"/>yet come into the world.</p>
<p> <lb n="52728"/>10 April:<emph></emph>@ Faintly, under the heavy night, through  the silence
<lb n="52729"/>of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as
<lb n="52730"/>a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs
<lb n="52731"/>upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the
<lb n="52732"/>bridge; and in a moment as they pass the darkened windows
<lb n="52733"/>the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard
<lb n="52734"/>now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy  night as gems,
<lb n="52735"/>hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's end &ndash;
<lb n="52736"/>what heart? &ndash;@ bearing what tidings?</p>
<p> <lb n="52737"/><emph>11 April:</emph>@ Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for a
<lb n="52738"/>vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should
<lb n="52739"/>have to like it also.</p>
<p> <lb n="52740"/><emph>13 April:</emph>@ That tundish has been on my mind for a long time.
<lb n="52741"/>I looked it up and find it is@ English and good old blunt English
<lb n="52742"/>too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he
<lb n="52743"/>come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from
<lb n="52744"/>us. Damn him one way or the other!</p>
<p> <lb n="52745"/><emph>14 April:</emph>@ John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from
<lb n="52746"/>the west of Ireland@ (European and Asiatic papers please copy).@
<lb n="52747"/>He told us he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old
<lb n="52748"/>man had red eyes and short pipe. Old man spoke Irish.
<lb n="52749"/>Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan spoke
<lb n="52750"/>English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old
<lb n="52751"/>man sat, listened, smoked, spat. Then said:
<lb n="52752"/><said who="???">--Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of
<lb n="52753"/>the world.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="52754"/>I fear him. I fear his redrimmed horny eyes. It is with him I
<lb n="52755"/>must struggle all through this night till day come, till he or I lie
<lb n="52756"/>dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till ....@ Till what? Till
<lb n="52757"/>he yield to me? No. I mean him no harm.</p>
<p> <lb n="52758"/><emph>15 April:</emph>@ Met her today pointblank in <place><location><geo>53.342556 -6.259573</geo></location><placeName>Grafton Street</placeName></place>. The
<lb n="52759"/>crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me
<lb n="52760"/>why I never came, said she had heard all sorts of stories about
<lb n="52761"/>me. This was only to gain time. Asked me@ was I writing poems.@
<lb n="52762"/>About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt
<lb n="52763"/>sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the
<lb n="52764"/>spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented
<lb n="52765"/>in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself
<lb n="52766"/>and my plans. In the midst of it unluckily I made a sudden
<lb n="52767"/>gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked like a
<lb n="52768"/>fellow throwing a handful of peas up@ into the air. People began
<lb n="52769"/>to look at us.  She shook hands a moment after and, in going
<lb n="52770"/>away, said she hoped I would do what I said.</p>
<p> <lb n="52771"/>Now I call that friendly, don't you?</p>
<p> <lb n="52772"/>Yes.@ I liked her today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked
<lb n="52773"/>her &ndash; and it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all
<lb n="52774"/>the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all
<lb n="52775"/>the rest before now, in fact ......@ O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it
<lb n="52776"/>off!</p>
<p> <lb n="52777"/><emph>16 April:</emph>@ Away! Away!</p>
<p> <lb n="52778"/>The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their
<lb n="52779"/>promise of close embraces and the black arms of tall ships that
<lb n="52780"/>stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are
<lb n="52781"/>held out to say: We are alone. Come. And the voices say with
<lb n="52782"/>them: We are your kinsmen.  And  the air is thick with their
<lb n="52783"/>company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go,
<lb n="52784"/>shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.</p>
<p> <lb n="52785"/><emph>26 April:</emph>@ Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in
<lb n="52786"/>order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life
<lb n="52787"/>and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it
<lb n="52788"/>feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the
<lb n="52789"/>millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the
<lb n="52790"/>smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.</p>
<p> <lb n="52791"/><emph>27 April:</emph>@ Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in
<lb n="52792"/>good stead.</p>
