<p> <lb n="40001"/>Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity,
<lb n="40002"/>Monday to the Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the Guardian Angels,
<lb n="40003"/>Wednesday to Saint Joseph, Thursday to the Most Blessed Sac-
<lb n="40004"/>rament of the Altar, Friday to the Suffering Jesus, Saturday to
<lb n="40005"/>the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
<p> <lb n="40006"/>Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of
<lb n="40007"/>some holy image or mystery. His day began with an heroic
<lb n="40008"/>offering of its every moment of thought or action for the intentions
<lb n="40009"/>tions of the sovereign pontiff and with an early mass. The raw
<lb n="40010"/>morning air whetted his resolute piety; and often as he knelt
<lb n="40011"/>among the few worshippers at the sidealtar, following with his
<lb n="40012"/>interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest, he glanced up
<lb n="40013"/>for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the gloom
<lb n="40014"/>between the two candles which were the old and the new
<lb n="40015"/>testaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the
<lb n="40016"/>catacombs.</p>
<p> <lb n="40017"/>His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of
<lb n="40018"/>ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the
<lb n="40019"/>souls in purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years;
<lb n="40020"/>yet the spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so
<lb n="40021"/>many fabulous ages of canonical penances did not wholly re-
<lb n="40022"/>ward his zeal of prayer since he could never know how much
<lb n="40023"/>temporal punishment he had remitted by way of suffrage for
<lb n="40024"/>the agonising souls: and, fearful lest in the midst of the purga-
<lb n="40025"/>torial fire, which differed from the infernal only in that it was
<lb n="40026"/>not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a drop of
<lb n="40027"/>moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle of
<lb n="40028"/>works of supererogation.</p>
<p> <lb n="40029"/>Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as
<lb n="40030"/>the duties of his station in life, circled about its own centre of
<lb n="40031"/>spiritual energy. His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity;
<lb n="40032"/>every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness
<lb n="40033"/>could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his
<lb n="40034"/>sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he
<lb n="40035"/>seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the
<lb n="40036"/>keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his
<lb n="40037"/>purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but
<lb n="40038"/>as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower.</p>
<p> <lb n="40039"/>The rosaries too which he said constantly - for he carried his
<lb n="40040"/>beads loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as
<lb n="40041"/>he walked the streets - transformed themselves into coronals of
<lb n="40042"/>flowers of such vague unearthly texture that they seemed to
<lb n="40043"/>him as hueless and odourless as they were nameless. He offered
<lb n="40044"/>up each of his three daily chaplets that his soul might grow
<lb n="40045"/>strong in each of the three theological virtues, in faith in the
<lb n="40046"/>Father@ Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had
<lb n="40047"/>redeemed him, and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanc-
<lb n="40048"/>tified him, and this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three
<lb n="40049"/>Persons@ through Mary in the name of her joyful and sorrowful
<lb n="40050"/>and glorious  mysteries.</p>
<p> <lb n="40051"/>On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that
<lb n="40052"/>one of the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon
<lb n="40053"/>his soul and drive out of it day by day the seven deadly sins
<lb n="40054"/>which had defiled it in the past; and he prayed for each gift on
<lb n="40055"/>its appointed day, confident that it would descend upon him,
<lb n="40056"/>though it seemed strange to him at times that wisdom and
<lb n="40057"/>understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their nature
<lb n="40058"/>that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he
<lb n="40059"/>believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this
<lb n="40060"/>difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been
<lb n="40061"/>raised up from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person
<lb n="40062"/>son of the Most Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more,
<lb n="40063"/>and with trepidation, because of the divine gloom and silence
<lb n="40064"/>wherein dwelt the unseen Paraclete, Whose symbols were a
<lb n="40065"/>dove and a mighty wind, to sin against Whom was a sin be-
<lb n="40066"/>yond forgiveness, the eternal, mysterious secret Being to
<lb n="40067"/>Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed
<lb n="40068"/>in the scarlet of the tongues of fire.</p>
<p> <lb n="40069"/>The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the
<lb n="40070"/>Three Persons of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the
<lb n="40071"/>books of devotion which he read - the Father contemplating
<lb n="40072"/>from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and
<lb n="40073"/>thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit
<lb n="40074"/>proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternity - were easier
<lb n="40075"/>of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incompre-
<lb n="40076"/>hensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul
<lb n="40077"/>from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the
<lb n="40078"/>world, for ages before the world itself had existed. He had
<lb n="40079"/>heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced
<lb n="40080"/>solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set
<lb n="40081"/>forth solemnly in books, and had wondered why his soul was
<lb n="40082"/>unable to harbour them for any time or to force his lips to utter
<lb n="40083"/>their names with conviction. A brief anger had often invested
<lb n="40084"/>him but he had never been able to make it an abiding passion
<lb n="40085"/>and had always felt himself passing out of it as if his very body
<lb n="40086"/>were being divested with ease of some outer skin or peel. He
<lb n="40087"/>had felt a subtle, dark and murmurous presence penetrate his
<lb n="40088"/>being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it too had
<lb n="40089"/>slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent.
<lb n="40090"/>This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his
<lb n="40091"/>soul would harbour.</p>
<p> <lb n="40092"/>But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since
<lb n="40093"/>God Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love
<lb n="40094"/>from all eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with
<lb n="40095"/>spiritual knowledge, he saw the whole world forming one vast
<lb n="40096"/>symmetrical expression of God's power and love. Life became a
<lb n="40097"/>divine gift for every moment and sensation of which, were it
<lb n="40098"/>even the sight of a single leaf hanging on the twig of a tree, his
<lb n="40099"/>soul should praise and thank the Giver. The world for all its
<lb n="40100"/>solid substance and complexity no longer existed for his soul
<lb n="40101"/>save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. So
<lb n="40102"/>entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning
<lb n="40103"/>in all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand
<lb n="40104"/>stand why it was in any way necessary that he should continue
<lb n="40105"/>to live. Yet that was part of the divine purpose and he
<lb n="40106"/>dared not question its use, he above all others who had sinned
<lb n="40107"/>so deeply and so foully against the divine purpose. Meek and
<lb n="40108"/>abased by this consciousness of the one eternal omnipresent
<lb n="40109"/>perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of pieties,
<lb n="40110"/>masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and
<lb n="40111"/>only then for the first time since he had brooded on the great
<lb n="40112"/>mystery of love did he feel within him a warm movement like
<lb n="40113"/>that of some newly born life or virtue of the soul itself. The
<lb n="40114"/>attitude of rapture in sacred art, the raised and parted hands,
<lb n="40115"/>the parted lips and eyes as of one about to swoon, became for
<lb n="40116"/>him an image of the soul in prayer, humiliated and faint before
<lb n="40117"/>her Creator.</p>
<p> <lb n="40118"/>But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exal-
<lb n="40119"/>tation and did not allow himself to desist from even the least or
<lb n="40120"/>lowliest devotion,  striving also by constant mortification to
<lb n="40121"/>undo the sinful past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught
<lb n="40122"/>with peril. Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous
<lb n="40123"/>discipline. In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his
<lb n="40124"/>rule to walk in the street with downcast eyes, glancing neither
<lb n="40125"/>to right nor left and never behind him. His eyes shunned every
<lb n="40126"/>encounter with the eyes of women. From time to time also he
<lb n="40127"/>balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting them
<lb n="40128"/>suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing
<lb n="40129"/>the book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his
<lb n="40130"/>voice which was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled and
<lb n="40131"/>made no attempt to flee from noises which caused him painful
<lb n="40132"/>nervous irritation such as the sharpening of knives on the
<lb n="40133"/>knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on the fireshovel and the
<lb n="40134"/>twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was more difficult
<lb n="40135"/>as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad odours,
<lb n="40136"/>whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as
<lb n="40137"/>those of dung and tar or the odours of his own person among
<lb n="40138"/>which he had made many curious comparisons and experiments.
<lb n="40139"/>ments. He found in the end that the only odour against which
<lb n="40140"/>his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like
<lb n="40141"/>that of longstanding urine: and whenever it was possible he
<lb n="40142"/>subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the taste
<lb n="40143"/>he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all the
<lb n="40144"/>fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind
<lb n="40145"/>from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification
<lb n="40146"/>cation of touch that he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of
<lb n="40147"/>inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in
<lb n="40148"/>bed, sat in the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently
<lb n="40149"/>every itch and pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his
<lb n="40150"/>knees all through the mass except at the gospels, left parts of
<lb n="40151"/>his neck and face undried so that air might sting them and,
<lb n="40152"/>whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his arms stiffly
<lb n="40153"/>at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or clasped
<lb n="40154"/>behind him.</p>
<p> <lb n="40155"/>He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him
<lb n="40156"/>however to find that at the end of his course of intricate piety
<lb n="40157"/>and selfrestraint he was so easily at the mercy of childish and
<lb n="40158"/>unworthy imperfections. His prayers and fasts availed him little
<lb n="40159"/>for the suppression of anger at hearing his mother sneeze or at
<lb n="40160"/>being disturbed in his devotions. It needed an immense effort of
<lb n="40161"/>his will to master the impulse which urged him to give outlet to
<lb n="40162"/>such irritation. Images of the outbursts of trivial anger which
<lb n="40163"/>he had often noted among his masters, their twitching mouths,
<lb n="40164"/>closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his memory, dis-
<lb n="40165"/>couraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the comparison.
<lb n="40166"/>son. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was
<lb n="40167"/>harder for him than any fasting or prayer, and it was his
<lb n="40168"/>constant failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused
<lb n="40169"/>in his soul at last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with
<lb n="40170"/>a growth of doubts and  scruples. His soul traversed a period of
<lb n="40171"/>desolation in which the sacraments themselves seemed to have
<lb n="40172"/>turned into dried up sources. His confession became a channel
<lb n="40173"/>for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented imperfections. His
<lb n="40174"/>actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him the same
<lb n="40175"/>dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did those spiritual
<lb n="40176"/>tual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some
<lb n="40177"/>visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for
<lb n="40178"/>these visits was an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus
<lb n="40179"/>sus Liguori, with fading characters and sere foxpapered leaves.
<lb n="40180"/>A faded world of fervent love and virginal responses seemed to
<lb n="40181"/>be evoked for his soul by the reading of its pages in which the
<lb n="40182"/>imagery of the canticles was interwoven with the communicant's
<lb n="40183"/>cant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the soul,
<lb n="40184"/>telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal
<lb n="40185"/>and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana
<lb n="40186"/>and from the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to
<lb n="40187"/>answer with the same inaudible voice, surrendering herself:
<p> <lb n="40188"/><seg xml:lang="la">Inter ubera mea commorabitur</seg>.</p>
<p> <lb n="40189"/>This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind
<lb n="40190"/>now that he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices
<lb n="40191"/>of the flesh which began to murmur to him again during his
<lb n="40192"/>prayers and meditations. It gave him an intense sense of power
<lb n="40193"/>to know that he  could by a single act of consent, in a moment
<lb n="40194"/>of thought, undo all that he had done. He seemed to feel a
<lb n="40195"/>flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet and to be waiting
<lb n="40196"/>ing for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch his
<lb n="40197"/>fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost
<lb n="40198"/>at the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far
<lb n="40199"/>away from the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of
<lb n="40200"/>the will or a sudden ejaculation: and, seeing the silver line of
<lb n="40201"/>the flood far away and beginning again its slow advance to-
<lb n="40202"/>wards his feet, a new thrill of power and satisfaction shook his
<lb n="40203"/>soul to know that he had not yielded nor undone all.</p>
<p> <lb n="40204"/>When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in
<lb n="40205"/>this way he grew troubled and wondered whether the grace
<lb n="40206"/>which he had refused to lose was not being filched from him
<lb n="40207"/>little by little. The clear certitude of his own immunity grew
<lb n="40208"/>dim and to it succeeded a vague fear that his soul had really
<lb n="40209"/>fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that he won back his old
<lb n="40210"/>consciousness of his state of grace by telling himself that he had
<lb n="40211"/>prayed to God at every temptation and that the grace which he
<lb n="40212"/>had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as God
<lb n="40213"/>was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of
<lb n="40214"/>temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard
<lb n="40215"/>about the trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations
<lb n="40216"/>were a proof that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that
<lb n="40217"/>the devil raged to make it fall.</p>
<p> <lb n="40218"/>Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some
<lb n="40219"/>momentary inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger
<lb n="40220"/>in his soul or a subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden
<lb n="40221"/>by his confessor to name some sin of his past life before absolution
<lb n="40222"/>ution was given him. He named it with humility and shame and
<lb n="40223"/>repented of it once more. It humiliated and shamed him to
<lb n="40224"/>think that he would never be freed from it wholly, however
<lb n="40225"/>holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections he might
<lb n="40226"/>attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present with
<lb n="40227"/>him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and
<lb n="40228"/>repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that
<lb n="40229"/>first hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had
<lb n="40230"/>not been good? Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent
<lb n="40231"/>doom, he had not had sincere sorrow for his sin? But the surest
<lb n="40232"/>sign that his confession had been good and that he had had
<lb n="40233"/>sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the amendment of his
<lb n="40234"/>life.

<p> <lb n="40236"/>The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back
<lb n="40237"/>to the light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and, as
<lb n="40238"/>he spoke and smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of
<lb n="40239"/>the other blind. Stephen stood before him, following for a mo-
<lb n="40240"/>ment with his eyes the waning of the long summer daylight
<lb n="40241"/>above the roofs or the slow deft movements of the priestly
<lb n="40242"/>fingers. The priest's face was in total shadow but the waning
<lb n="40243"/>daylight from behind him touched the deeply grooved temples
<lb n="40244"/>and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with his ears
<lb n="40245"/>the accents and intervals of the priest's voice as he spoke
<lb n="40246"/>gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which
<lb n="40247"/>had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference
<lb n="40248"/>ence of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily
<lb n="40249"/>with its tale, and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on
<lb n="40250"/>again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a
<lb n="40251"/>prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the
<lb n="40252"/>message of summons had come for him from the director his
<lb n="40253"/>mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message; and
<lb n="40254"/>during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour
<lb n="40255"/>waiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from
<lb n="40256"/>one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind had
<lb n="40257"/>wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the
<lb n="40258"/>summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing
<lb n="40259"/>ing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from
<lb n="40260"/>coming@ he had heard the handle of the door turning and the
<lb n="40261"/>swish of a soutane.</p>
<p> <lb n="40262"/>The director had begun to speak of the dominican and fran-
<lb n="40263"/>ciscan orders and of the friendship between saint Thomas and
<lb n="40264"/>saint Bonaventure. The capuchin dress, he thought, was rather
<lb n="40265"/>too .......@</p>
<p> <lb n="40266"/>Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not
<lb n="40267"/>being anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative
<lb n="40268"/>movement with his lips.
<lb n="40269"/><said who="the director">--I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now
<lb n="40270"/>among the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and
<lb n="40271"/>following the example of the other franciscans.</said>
<lb n="40272"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--I suppose they would retain it in the cloister, said Stephen.</said>
<lb n="40273"/><said who="the director">--O@ certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right
<lb n="40274"/>but for the street I really think it would be better to do away
<lb n="40275"/>with it@, don't you?</said>
<lb n="40276"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">--It must be troublesome, I imagine.@</said>
<lb n="40277"/><said who="Priest">--Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Bel-
<lb n="40278"/>gium I used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with
<lb n="40279"/>this thing up about their knees! It was really ridiculous. <seg xml:lang="fr">Les
<lb n="40280"/>jupes</seg>, they call them in Belgium.</p>
<p> <lb n="40281"/>The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct.

<lb n="40283"/><said who="Priest">--<seg xml:lang="fr">Les jupes.</seg></said>
<lb n="40284"/><said who="Stephen Dedalus">O.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="40285"/>Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could
<lb n="40286"/>not see on the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only
<lb n="40287"/>passing rapidly across his mind as the low discreet accent fell
<lb n="40288"/>upon his ear. He gazed calmly before him at the waning sky,
<lb n="40289"/>glad of the cool of the evening and the faint yellow glow
<lb n="40290"/>which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his cheek.</p>
<p> <lb n="40291"/>The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain
<lb n="40292"/>soft and delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to
<lb n="40293"/>his mind a delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined
<lb n="40294"/>ined the reins by which horses are driven as slender silken
<lb n="40295"/>bands and it shocked him to feel at <place><location><geo>53.293003 -6.168866</geo></location><placeName>Stradbrook</placeName></place> the greasy
<lb n="40296"/>leather of harness. It had shocked him too when he had felt for
<lb n="40297"/>the first time beneath his tremulous fingers the brittle texture of
<lb n="40298"/>a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all he read save
<lb n="40299"/>that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own
<lb n="40300"/>state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft
<lb n="40301"/>stuffs that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman
<lb n="40302"/>moving with tender life.</p>
<p> <lb n="40303"/>But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he
<lb n="40304"/>knew that a priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The
<lb n="40305"/>phrase had been spoken lightly with design and he felt that his
<lb n="40306"/>face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever
<lb n="40307"/>he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside
<lb n="40308"/>frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters,
<lb n="40309"/>even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him
<lb n="40310"/>always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and highspirited
<lb n="40311"/>prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies
<lb n="40312"/>briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all
<lb n="40313"/>the years he had lived among them in <place><location><geo>53.310601 -6.695541</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place>
and in <place><location><geo>52.207800 -8.211070</geo></location><placeName>Bel-
<lb n="40314"/>vedere</placeName></place> he had received only two pandies and, though these had
<lb n="40315"/>been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped
<lb n="40316"/>punishment. During all those years he had never heard from
<lb n="40317"/>any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught
<lb n="40318"/>him christian doctrine and urged him to live a good life and,
<lb n="40319"/>when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who had led
<lb n="40320"/>him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of
<lb n="40321"/>himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him
<lb n="40322"/>diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal
<lb n="40323"/>position in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained
<lb n="40324"/>with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never
<lb n="40325"/>once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him
<lb n="40326"/>from his habit of quiet obedience: and, even when he doubted
<lb n="40327"/>some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt
<lb n="40328"/>openly. Lately some of their judgments had sounded a little
<lb n="40329"/>childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as
<lb n="40330"/>though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and
<lb n="40331"/>were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some
<lb n="40332"/>boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the
<lb n="40333"/>chapel@ he had heard the priest say:</p>
<p> <lb n="40334"/>--I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never
<lb n="40335"/>committed a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate
<lb n="40336"/>mortal sin.</p>
<p> <lb n="40337"/>Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo
<lb n="40338"/>were not the greatest French writer. The priest had answered
<lb n="40339"/>that Victor Hugo had never written half so well when he had
<lb n="40340"/>turned against the church as he had written when he was a
<lb n="40341"/>catholic.
<lb n="40342"/><said who="Priest">--But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest,
<lb n="40343"/>who consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was,
<lb n="40344"/>had not so pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.</p>
<p> <lb n="40345"/>The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon
<lb n="40346"/>Stephen's cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still
<lb n="40347"/>fixed calmly on the colorless sky. But an unresting doubt flew
<lb n="40348"/>hither and thither before his mind. Masked memories passed
<lb n="40349"/>quickly before him: he recognised scenes and persons yet he
<lb n="40350"/>was conscious that he had failed to perceive some vital circumstance
<lb n="40351"/>stance in them. He saw himself walking about the grounds
<lb n="40352"/>watching the sports in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> and eating slim jim out of his
<lb n="40353"/>cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in
<lb n="40354"/>the company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used
<lb n="40355"/>in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> sounded in remote caves of his mind.</p>
<p> <lb n="40356"/>His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the si-
<lb n="40357"/>lence of the parlour when he became aware that the priest was
<lb n="40358"/>addressing him in a different voice.</p>
<p> <lb n="40359"/>--I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to
<lb n="40360"/>you on a very important subject.</p>
<p> <lb n="40361"/>--Yes, sir.</p>
<p> <lb n="40362"/>--Have you ever felt that you had a vocation?</p>
<p> <lb n="40363"/>Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the
<lb n="40364"/>word suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added:</p>
<p> <lb n="40365"/>--I mean have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a
<lb n="40366"/>desire to join the order. Think.</p>
<p> <lb n="40367"/>--I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen.</p>
<p> <lb n="40368"/>The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his
<lb n="40369"/>hands, leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with
<lb n="40370"/>himself.
<lb n="40371"/><said who="Priest">--In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or
<lb n="40372"/>perhaps two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life.
<lb n="40373"/>Such a boy is marked off from his companions by his piety, by
<lb n="40374"/>the good example he shows to others. He is looked up to by
<lb n="40375"/>them; he is chosen perhaps as prefect by his fellow sodalists.
<lb n="40376"/>And you, Stephen, have been such a boy in this college, prefect
<lb n="40377"/>of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you are the boy in this
<lb n="40378"/>college whom God designs to call to Himself.</p>
<p> <lb n="40379"/>A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's
<lb n="40380"/>voice made Stephen's heart quicken in response.</p>
<p> <lb n="40381"/>--To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest
<lb n="40382"/>honour that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No
<lb n="40383"/>king or emperor on this earth has the power of the priest
<lb n="40384"/>of God. No angel or archangel in heaven, no saint, not even
<lb n="40385"/>the Blessed Virgin herself has the power of a priest of God: the
<lb n="40386"/>power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose from sin, the
<lb n="40387"/>power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the creatures of
<lb n="40388"/>God the evil spirits that have power over them, the power, the
<lb n="40389"/>authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon
<lb n="40390"/>the altar and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful
<lb n="40391"/>power, Stephen!</p>
<p> <lb n="40392"/>A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he
<lb n="40393"/>heard in this proud address an echo of his own proud musings.
<lb n="40394"/>How often had he seen himself as a priest wielding calmly and
<lb n="40395"/>humbly the awful power of which angels and saints stood in
<lb n="40396"/>reverence! His soul had loved to muse in secret on this desire.
<lb n="40397"/>He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered priest, en-
<lb n="40398"/>tering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps, in-
<lb n="40399"/>censing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the
<lb n="40400"/>priesthood which pleased him by reason of their semblance of
<lb n="40401"/>reality and of their distance from it. In that dim life which he
<lb n="40402"/>had lived through in his musings he had assumed the voices and
<lb n="40403"/>gestures which he had noted with various priests. He had bent
<lb n="40404"/>his knee sideways like such a one, he had shaken the thurible
<lb n="40405"/>only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had swung open like
<lb n="40406"/>that of such another as he had turned to the altar again after
<lb n="40407"/>having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to
<lb n="40408"/>fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He
<lb n="40409"/>shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him
<lb n="40410"/>to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own
<lb n="40411"/>person or that the ritual should assign to him so clear and final
<lb n="40412"/>an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested
<lb n="40413"/>with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from
<lb n="40414"/>the altar, forgotten by the people, his shoulders covered with a
<lb n="40415"/>humeral veil, holding the paten within its folds, or, when the
<lb n="40416"/>sacrifice had  been accomplished, to stand as deacon in a dal-
<lb n="40417"/>matic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his
<lb n="40418"/>hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the
<lb n="40419"/>chant <seg xml:lang="la">Ite, missa est</seg>. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was
<lb n="40420"/>as in the pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a
<lb n="40421"/>church without worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice,
<lb n="40422"/>at a bare altar and served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish
<lb n="40423"/>than himself. In vague sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his
<lb n="40424"/>will seemed drawn to go forth to encounter reality: and it was
<lb n="40425"/>partly the absence of an appointed rite which had always con-
<lb n="40426"/>strained him to inaction whether he had allowed silence to
<lb n="40427"/>cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an embrace he
<lb n="40428"/>longed to give.</p>
<p> <lb n="40429"/>He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and
<lb n="40430"/>through the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bid-
<lb n="40431"/>ding him approach, offering him secret knowledge and secret
<lb n="40432"/>power. He would know then what was the sin  of Simon Magus
<lb n="40433"/>and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for which there was
<lb n="40434"/>no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden from
<lb n="40435"/>others, from those who  were conceived and born children of
<lb n="40436"/>wrath. He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful
<lb n="40437"/>thoughts and sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured
<lb n="40438"/>into his ears in the confessional under the shame of a darkened
<lb n="40439"/>chapel by the lips of women and of girls: but rendered immune
<lb n="40440"/>mysteriously at his ordination by the imposition of hands his
<lb n="40441"/>soul would pass again uncontaminated to the white peace of
<lb n="40442"/>the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands with
<lb n="40443"/>which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin
<lb n="40444"/>would linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink
<lb n="40445"/>damnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. He
<lb n="40446"/>would hold his secret knowledge and secret power, being as
<lb n="40447"/>sinless as the innocent: and he would be a priest for ever
<lb n="40448"/>according to the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p> <lb n="40449"/>--I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director,
<lb n="40450"/>tor, that Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And
<lb n="40451"/>let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first
<lb n="40452"/>martyr, who is very powerful with God, that God may en-
<lb n="40453"/>lighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, that
<lb n="40454"/>you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found
<lb n="40455"/>afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest,
<lb n="40456"/>remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy
<lb n="40457"/>Orders is one of those which can be received only once because
<lb n="40458"/>it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can
<lb n="40459"/>never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It
<lb n="40460"/>is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the
<lb n="40461"/>salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God to-
<lb n="40462"/>gether.</p>
<p> <lb n="40463"/>He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if
<lb n="40464"/>already to a companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out
<lb n="40465"/>on to  the wide platform above the steps and was conscious of
<lb n="40466"/>the caress of mild evening air. Towards <place><location><geo>53.354445 -6.263812</geo></location><placeName>Findlater's church</placeName></place> a
<lb n="40467"/>quartet of young men were striding along with linked arms,
<lb n="40468"/>swaying their heads and stepping to the agile melody of their
<lb n="40469"/>leader's concertina. The music passed in an instant, as the first
<lb n="40470"/>bars of sudden music always did, over the fantastic fabrics of
<lb n="40471"/>his mind, dissolving them painlessly and noiselessly as a sudden
<lb n="40472"/>wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of children. Smiling at the
<lb n="40473"/>trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's face and, seeing in it
<lb n="40474"/>a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, detached his hand
<lb n="40475"/>slowly which had acquiesced  faintly in that companionship.</p>
<p> <lb n="40476"/>As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his
<lb n="40477"/>troubled selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting
<lb n="40478"/>a sunken day from the threshold of the college. The shadow,
<lb n="40479"/>then, of the life of the college passed gravely over his consciousness.
<lb n="40480"/>ness. It was a grave and ordered and passionless life that
<lb n="40481"/>awaited him, a life without material cares. He wondered how
<lb n="40482"/>he would pass the first night in the novitiate and with what
<lb n="40483"/>dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. The
<lb n="40484"/>troubling odour of the long corridors of <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> came back
<lb n="40485"/>to him and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning
<lb n="40486"/>gasflames. At once from every part of his being unrest began to
<lb n="40487"/>irradiate. A feverish quickening of his pulses followed and a din
<lb n="40488"/>of meaningless words drove his reasoned thoughts hither and
<lb n="40489"/>thither confusedly. His lungs dilated and sank as if he were
<lb n="40490"/>inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he smelt again the
<lb n="40491"/>warm moist air which hung in the bath in <place><location><geo>53.348746 -6.275034</geo></location><placeName>Clongowes</placeName></place> above the
<lb n="40492"/>sluggish turfcoloured water.</p>
<p> <lb n="40493"/>Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than edu-
<lb n="40494"/>cation or piety, quickened within him at every near approach
<lb n="40495"/>to that life, an instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him
<lb n="40496"/>against acquiescence. The chill and order of the life repelled
<lb n="40497"/>him. He saw himself rising in the cold of the morning and filing
<lb n="40498"/>down with the others to early mass and trying vainly to
<lb n="40499"/>struggle with his prayers against the fainting sickness of his
<lb n="40500"/>stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the community
<lb n="40501"/>of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted shyness of
<lb n="40502"/>his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange
<lb n="40503"/>roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had
<lb n="40504"/>always made him conceive himself as a being apart in every
<lb n="40505"/>order?</p>
<p> <lb n="40506"/>The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J.</p>
<p> <lb n="40507"/>His name in that new life leaped into characters before his
<lb n="40508"/>eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an unde-
<lb n="40509"/>fined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became
<lb n="40510"/>strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw
<lb n="40511"/>reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the
<lb n="40512"/>shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured
<lb n="40513"/>voured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger.
<lb n="40514"/>Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the jesuits
<lb n="40515"/>whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy
<lb n="40516"/>Campbell?</p>
<p> <lb n="40517"/>He was passing at that moment before the <place><location><geo>53.358000 -6.259655</geo></location><placeName>jesuit house in
<lb n="40518"/>Gardiner Street</placeName></place>, and wondered vaguely which window would
<lb n="40519"/>be his if he ever joined the order. Then he wondered at the
<lb n="40520"/>vagueness of his wonder, at the remoteness of his soul
<lb n="40521"/>from what he had hitherto imagined her sanctuary, at the frail
<lb n="40522"/>hold which so many years of order and obedience had of him
<lb n="40523"/>when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened to
<lb n="40524"/>end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of
<lb n="40525"/>the director urging upon him the proud claims of the church
<lb n="40526"/>and the mystery and power of the priestly office repeated itself
<lb n="40527"/>idly in his memory. His soul was not there to hear and greet it
<lb n="40528"/>and he knew now that the exhortation he had listened to had
<lb n="40529"/>already fallen into an idle formal tale. He would never swing
<lb n="40530"/>the thurible  before the tabernacle as priest. His destiny was to
<lb n="40531"/>be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of the
<lb n="40532"/>priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined
<lb n="40533"/>to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the
<lb n="40534"/>wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the
<lb n="40535"/>world.</p>
<p> <lb n="40536"/>The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall.
<lb n="40537"/>He had not yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant.
<lb n="40538"/>Not to fall was too hard, too hard: and he felt the silent lapse
<lb n="40539"/>of his soul, as it would be at some instant to come, falling,
<lb n="40540"/>falling but not yet fallen, still unfallen but about to fall.</p>
<p> <lb n="40541"/>He crossed the bridge over the stream of the <place><location><geo> 53.361845 -6.242480</geo></location><placeName>Tolka</placeName></place> and
<lb n="40542"/>turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded blue
<lb n="40543"/>shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowlwise on a pole in
<lb n="40544"/>the middle of a hamshaped encampment of poor cottages.
<lb n="40545"/>Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to
<lb n="40546"/>his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came to-
<lb n="40547"/>wards him from the kitchengardens on the rising ground above
<lb n="40548"/>the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the
<lb n="40549"/>misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation
<lb n="40550"/>of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a
<lb n="40551"/>short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary
<lb n="40552"/>farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they
<lb n="40553"/>had nicknamed the man with the hat. A second laugh, taking
<lb n="40554"/>rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily
<lb n="40555"/>as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering
<lb n="40556"/>in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging
<lb n="40557"/>his spade in the earth.</p>
<p> <lb n="40558"/>He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed
<lb n="40559"/>through the naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his
<lb n="40560"/>brothers and sisters was sitting round the table. Tea was nearly
<lb n="40561"/>over and only the last of the second watered tea remained in
<lb n="40562"/>the bottoms of the small glassjars and jampots which did ser-
<lb n="40563"/>vice for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of sugared bread,
<lb n="40564"/>turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them, lay
<lb n="40565"/>scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on
<lb n="40566"/>the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck
<lb n="40567"/>through the pith of a ravaged turnover.</p>
<p> <lb n="40568"/>The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through
<lb n="40569"/>the window and the open door, covering over and allaying
<lb n="40570"/>quietly a sudden instinct of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that
<lb n="40571"/>had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest:
<lb n="40572"/>but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign
<lb n="40573"/>of rancour.</p>
<p> <lb n="40574"/>He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and
<lb n="40575"/>mother were. One answered:</p>
<p> <lb n="40576"/>--Goneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro.</p>
<p> <lb n="40577"/>Still another removal! A boy named Fallon in Belvedere had
<lb n="40578"/>often asked him with a silly laugh why they moved so often. A
<lb n="40579"/>frown of scorn darkened quickly his forehead as he heard again
<lb n="40580"/>the silly laugh of the questioner.</p>
<p> <lb n="40581"/>He asked:</p>
<p> <lb n="40582"/>--Why are we on the move again, if it's a fair question?</p>
<p> <lb n="40583"/>The same sister answered:</p>
<p> <lb n="40584"/>--Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro
<lb n="40585"/>usboro outboro.</p>
<p> <lb n="40586"/>The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of
<lb n="40587"/>the fireplace began to sing the air <emph>Oft in the Stilly Night</emph>. One
<lb n="40588"/>by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was
<lb n="40589"/>singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody,
<lb n="40590"/>glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon,
<lb n="40591"/>till the first dark nightclouds came forth and night fell.</p>
<p> <lb n="40592"/>He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took
<lb n="40593"/>up the air with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the
<lb n="40594"/>overtone of weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices.
<lb n="40595"/>Even before they set out on life's journey they seemed weary
<lb n="40596"/>already of the way.</p>
<p> <lb n="40597"/>He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and mul-
<lb n="40598"/>tiplied through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless
<lb n="40599"/>generations of children: and heard in all the echoes an echo also
<lb n="40600"/>of the recurring note of weariness and pain. All seemed weary
<lb n="40601"/>of life even before entering upon it. And he remembered that
<lb n="40602"/>Newman had heard this note also in the broken lines of Virgil
<lb n="40603"/><emph>giving utterance, like the voice of Nature herself, to that pain
<lb n="40604"/><emph>and weariness yet hope of better things which has been the
<lb n="40605"/><emph>experience of her children in every time.</emph></p>

<lb n="40610"/>then back again to the publichouse he had paced slowly at first,
<lb n="40611"/>planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork
<lb n="40612"/>of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses. A full
<lb n="40613"/>hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby,
<lb n="40614"/>the tutor, to find out for him something about the <place><location><geo>53.310485 -6.225058</geo></location><placeName>university</placeName></place>.
<lb n="40615"/>For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he
<lb n="40616"/>could wait no longer.</p>
<p> <lb n="40617"/>He set off abruptly for <place><location><geo>53.359381 -6.179831</geo></location><placeName>the Bull</placeName></place>, walking rapidly lest his
<lb n="40618"/>father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few mo-
<lb n="40619"/>ments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was
<lb n="40620"/>safe.</p>
<p> <lb n="40621"/>Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he  had read from
<lb n="40622"/>her listless silence. Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly
<lb n="40623"/>than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had
<lb n="40624"/>watched the faith which was fading down in his soul aging and
<lb n="40625"/>strengthening in her eyes. A dim antagonism gathered force
<lb n="40626"/>within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her dis-
<lb n="40627"/>loyalty: and when it  passed, cloudlike, leaving his mind serene
<lb n="40628"/>and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and
<lb n="40629"/>without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.</p>
<p> <lb n="40630"/>The university! So he had passed beyond the challenge of the
<lb n="40631"/>sentries who had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had
<lb n="40632"/>sought to keep him among them that he might be subject to
<lb n="40633"/>them and serve their ends. Pride after satisfaction uplifted him
<lb n="40634"/>like long slow waves. The end he had been born to serve yet
<lb n="40635"/>did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path: and now it
<lb n="40636"/>beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to
<lb n="40637"/>be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful
<lb n="40638"/>music leaping upwards a tone and downwards a diminished
<lb n="40639"/>fourth, upwards a tone and downwards a major third, like
<lb n="40640"/>triplebranching flames leaping fitfully, flame after flame, out of
<lb n="40641"/>a midnight wood. It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless;
<lb n="40642"/>and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of
<lb n="40643"/>time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses
<lb n="40644"/>wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the
<lb n="40645"/>leaves. Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the
<lb n="40646"/>feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and ante-
<lb n="40647"/>lopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a
<lb n="40648"/>proud cadence from Newman: <emph>Whose feet are as the feet of
<lb n="40649"/><emph>harts and underneath the everlasting arms.</emph></p>
<p> <lb n="40650"/>The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the
<lb n="40651"/>dignity of the office he had refused. All through his boyhood he
<lb n="40652"/>had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his
<lb n="40653"/>destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the
<lb n="40654"/>call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct. Now
<lb n="40655"/>time lay between: the oils of ordination would never anoint his
<lb n="40656"/>body. He had refused. Why?</p>
<p> <lb n="40657"/>He turned seaward  from the road at <place><location><geo>53.365979 -6.174239</geo></location><placeName>Dollymount</placeName></place> and as he
<lb n="40658"/>passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking
<lb n="40659"/>with the tramp of heavily shod feet. A squad of christian
<lb n="40660"/>brothers was on its way back from the <place><location><geo>53.369769 -6.147334</geo></location><placeName>Bull</placeName></place> and had begun to
<lb n="40661"/>pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was
<lb n="40662"/>trembling and resounding. The uncouth faces passed him two
<lb n="40663"/>by two, stained yellow or red or livid by the sea, and as he
<lb n="40664"/>strove to look at them with ease and indifference, a faint stain
<lb n="40665"/>of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face.
<lb n="40666"/>Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by
<lb n="40667"/>gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under
<lb n="40668"/>the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their topheavy
<lb n="40669"/>silk hats, and humble tapelike collars and loosely hanging cleri-
<lb n="40670"/>cal clothes.
<lb n="40671"/><said who:"Stephen Dedalus"/>--Brother Hickey.
<lb n="40672"/>Brother Quaid.
<lb n="40673"/>Brother MacArdle.
<lb n="40674"/>Brother Keogh.</said></p>
<p> <lb n="40675"/>Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like
<lb n="40676"/>their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their
<lb n="40677"/>humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute
<lb n="40678"/>of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable
<lb n="40679"/>able than his elaborate adoration. It was idle for him to move
<lb n="40680"/>himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he
<lb n="40681"/>ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in
<lb n="40682"/>beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him,
<lb n="40683"/>loving him as themselves. Idle and embittering, finally,  to ar-
<lb n="40684"/>gue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the com-
<lb n="40685"/>mandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour  as
<lb n="40686"/>ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to
<lb n="40687"/>love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.</p>
<p> <lb n="40688"/>He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly
<lb n="40689"/>to himself:</p>
<p> <lb n="40690"/>--A day of dappled seaborne clouds.</p>
<p> <lb n="40691"/>The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a
<lb n="40692"/>chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow
<lb n="40693"/>and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of
<lb n="40694"/>apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of
<lb n="40695"/>clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and
<lb n="40696"/>balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise
<lb n="40697"/>and fall of words better than their associations of legend and
<lb n="40698"/>colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of
<lb n="40699"/>mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing
<lb n="40700"/>sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured
<lb n="40701"/>and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner
<lb n="40702"/>world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid
<lb n="40703"/>supple periodic prose?</p>
<p> <lb n="40704"/>He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
<lb n="40705"/>At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and
<lb n="40706"/>looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall dark-
<lb n="40707"/>ening and crisping suddenly the tide. A faint click at his heart, a
<lb n="40708"/>faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh
<lb n="40709"/>dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not
<lb n="40710"/>strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along
<lb n="40711"/>the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.</p>
<p> <lb n="40712"/>A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where
<lb n="40713"/>the river was embayed. In the distance along the course of the
<lb n="40714"/>slowflowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more
<lb n="40715"/>distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze. Like a
<lb n="40716"/>scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image
<lb n="40717"/>of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the
<lb n="40718"/>timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection
<lb n="40719"/>tion than in the days of the thingmote.</p>
<p> <lb n="40720"/>Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting
<lb n="40721"/>clouds, dappled and seaborne. They were voyaging across the
<lb n="40722"/>deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging
<lb n="40723"/>high over Ireland, westward bound. The Europe they had come
<lb n="40724"/>from lay out there beyond the <place><location><geo>53.13 -5.32</geo></location><placeName>Irish Sea</placeName></place>, Europe of strange
<lb n="40725"/>tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of
<lb n="40726"/>entrenched and marshalled races. He heard a confused music
<lb n="40727"/>within him as of memories and names which he was almost
<lb n="40728"/>conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the
<lb n="40729"/>music seemed to recede, to  recede, to recede: and from each
<lb n="40730"/>receding trail of nebulous music there fell always one long-
<lb n="40731"/>drawn calling note, piercing like a star the dusk of silence.
<lb n="40732"/>Again! Again! Again! Again! A voice from beyond the world
<lb n="40733"/>was calling.
<lb n="40734"/><said who="a voice">--Hello, Stephanos!</said>
<lb n="40735"/><said who="a voice">--Here comes The Dedalus!</said>
<lb n="40736"/><said who="a voice">--Ao! ... Eh, give it over, Dwyer, I'm telling you or I'll give you
<lb n="40737"/>a stuff in the kisser for yourself .... Ao!</said>
<lb n="40738"/><said who="a voice">--Good man, Towser! Duck him!</said
<lb n="40739"/><said who="a voice">--Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Steph-
<lb n="40740"/>aneforos!</said>
<lb n="40741"/><said who="a voice">--Duck him! Guzzle him now, Towser!</said>
<lb n="40742"/><said who="a voice">--Help! Help! ... Ao!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="40743"/>He recognised their speech collectively before he distin-
<lb n="40744"/>guished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet
<lb n="40745"/>nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite
<lb n="40746"/>or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the
<lb n="40747"/>sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their divingstone, poised
<lb n="40748"/>on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the
<lb n="40749"/>roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they
<lb n="40750"/>scrambled in their horseplay, gleamed with cold wet lustre. The
<lb n="40751"/>towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with
<lb n="40752"/>cold seawater: and drenched with cold brine was their matted
<lb n="40753"/>hair.</p>
<p> <lb n="40754"/>He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their
<lb n="40755"/>banter with easy words. How characterless they looked: Shuley
<lb n="40756"/>without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet
<lb n="40757"/>belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly  without his <place><location><geo>52.613969 0.886402</geo></location><placeName>Norfolk</placeName></place>
<lb n="40758"/>coat with the flapless sidepockets!  It was a pain to see them and
<lb n="40759"/>a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made
<lb n="40760"/>repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had taken refuge
<lb n="40761"/>uge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
<lb n="40762"/>But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what
<lb n="40763"/>dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.</p>
<p> <lb n="40764"/>--Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!</p>
<lb n="40765"/>foros!</p>
<p> <lb n="40766"/>Their banter was not new to him and now it
<lb n="40767"/>flattered his mild proud sovereignty. Now, as never before, his
<lb n="40768"/>strange name seemed to him a prophecy. So timeless seemed
<lb n="40769"/>the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that
<lb n="40770"/>all ages were as one to him. A moment before the ghost of
<lb n="40771"/>the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the
<lb n="40772"/>vesture of the hazewrapped city. Now, at the name of the
<lb n="40773"/>fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves
<lb n="40774"/>and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly
<lb n="40775"/>climbing the air. What did it mean? Was it a quaint device
<lb n="40776"/>opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and sym-
<lb n="40777"/>bols, a hawklike man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy
<lb n="40778"/>of the end he had been born to serve and had been following
<lb n="40779"/>through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the
<lb n="40780"/>artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter
<lb n="40781"/>of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?</p>
<p> <lb n="40782"/>His heart trembled;  his breath came faster and a wild spirit
<lb n="40783"/>passed over his limbs as though he were soaring sunward. His
<lb n="40784"/>heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight.
<lb n="40785"/>His soul was soaring in an air beyond the world and the body
<lb n="40786"/>he knew was purified in a breath and delivered of incertitude
<lb n="40787"/>and made radiant and commingled with the element of the
<lb n="40788"/>spirit. An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his
<lb n="40789"/>breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept
<lb n="40790"/>limbs.
<lb n="40790"/><said who="a voice">--One! Two! ... Look out!</said>
<lb n="40792"/><said who="a voice">--O, cripes, I'm drownded!</said>
<lb n="40793"/><said who="a voice">--One! Two! Three and away!</said>
<lb n="40794"/><said who="a voice">--Me next! Me next!</said>
<lb n="40795"/><said who="a voice">--One! ... Uk!</said>
<lb n="40796"/><said who="a voice">--Stephaneforos!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="40797"/>His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a
<lb n="40798"/>hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to
<lb n="40799"/>the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross
<lb n="40800"/>voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice
<lb n="40801"/>that had called him to the pale service of the altar. An instant
<lb n="40802"/>of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which
<lb n="40803"/>his lips withheld cleft his brain.
<lb n="40804"/><said who="a voice">--Stephaneforos!</said></p>
<p> <lb n="40805"/>What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of
<lb n="40806"/>death death - the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude
<lb n="40807"/>that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him
<lb n="40808"/>within and without - cerements, the linens of the grave?</p>
<p> <lb n="40809"/>His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her
<lb n="40810"/>graveclothes. Yes! Yes! Yes! He would create proudly out of the
<lb n="40811"/>freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose
<lb n="40812"/>name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful,
<lb n="40813"/>impalpable, imperishable.</p>
<p> <lb n="40814"/>He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no
<lb n="40815"/>longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks aflame
<lb n="40816"/>and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wan-
<lb n="40817"/>dering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the
<lb n="40818"/>earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen
<lb n="40819"/>above the sea, night fall upon the plains, dawn glimmer before
<lb n="40820"/>the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces.
<lb n="40821"/>Where?</p>
<p> <lb n="40822"/>He looked northward towards <place><location><geo>53.378569 -6.057013</geo></location><placeName>Howth</placeName></place>. The sea had fallen
<lb n="40823"/>below the line of seawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater
<lb n="40824"/>water and already the tide was running out fast along the
<lb n="40825"/>foreshore. Already one long oval bank of sand lay warm and
<lb n="40826"/>dry amid the wavelets. Here and there warm isles of sand
<lb n="40827"/>gleamed above the shallow tide, and about the isles and around
<lb n="40828"/>the long bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were
<lb n="40829"/>lightclad gayclad figures, wading and delving.</p>
<p> <lb n="40830"/>In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in
<lb n="40831"/>his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces
<lb n="40832"/>over his shoulders: and, picking a pointed salteaten stick out of
<lb n="40833"/>the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of
<lb n="40834"/>the breakwater.</p>
<p> <lb n="40835"/>There was a long rivulet in the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName>strand</placeName></place>: and, as he waded
<lb n="40836"/>slowly up its course, he wondered at the endless drift of sea-
<lb n="40837"/>weed. Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved
<lb n="40838"/>beneath the current, swaying and turning. The water of the
<lb n="40839"/>rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the highdrifting
<lb n="40840"/>ing clouds. The clouds were drifting above him silently and
<lb n="40841"/>silently the seatangle was drifting below him; and the grey
<lb n="40842"/>warm air was still: and a new wild life was singing in his veins.</p>
<p> <lb n="40843"/>Where was his boyhood now? Where was the soul that had
<lb n="40844"/>hung back from her destiny, to brood alone upon the shame of
<lb n="40845"/>her wounds and in her house of squalor and subterfuge to
<lb n="40846"/>queen it in faded cerements and in wreaths that withered at the
<lb n="40847"/>touch? Or where was he?</p>
<p> <lb n="40848"/>He was alone. He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild
<lb n="40849"/>heart of life. He was alone and young and wilful and wild-
<lb n="40850"/>hearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters
<lb n="40851"/>and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight
<lb n="40852"/>and gayclad lightclad figures, of children and girls and voices
<lb n="40853"/>childish and girlish in the air.</p>
<p> <lb n="40854"/>A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing
<lb n="40855"/>out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into
<lb n="40856"/>the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender
<lb n="40857"/>bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an
<lb n="40858"/>emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the
<lb n="40859"/>flesh. Her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared al-
<lb n="40860"/>most to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were
<lb n="40861"/>like featherings of soft white down. Her slateblue skirts were
<lb n="40862"/>kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her
<lb n="40863"/>bosom was as  a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the
<lb n="40864"/>breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was
<lb n="40865"/>girlish; and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal
<lb n="40866"/>beauty, her face.</p>
<p> <lb n="40867"/>She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt
<lb n="40868"/>his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him
<lb n="40869"/>in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness.
<lb n="40870"/>Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her
<lb n="40871"/>eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring
<lb n="40872"/>the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise
<lb n="40873"/>of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and
<lb n="40874"/>whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither
<lb n="40875"/>and thither: and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.</p>
<p> <lb n="40876"/>--Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of pro-
<lb n="40877"/>fane joy.</p>
<p> <lb n="40878"/>He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the <place><location><geo>53.366498 -6.147804</geo></location><placeName>
<lb n="40879"/>strand</placeName></place>. His cheeks  were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs
<lb n="40880"/>were trembling. On and on and on and on he strode, far out
<lb n="40881"/>over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the
<lb n="40882"/>advent of the life that had cried to him.</p>
<p> <lb n="40883"/>Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had
<lb n="40884"/>broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. Her eyes had called him
<lb n="40885"/>and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to
<lb n="40886"/>triumph, to recreate life out of life! A wild angel had appeared
<lb n="40887"/>to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from
<lb n="40888"/>the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of
<lb n="40889"/>ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. On and on
<lb n="40890"/>and on and on!</p>
<p> <lb n="40891"/>He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence. How
<lb n="40892"/>far had he walked? What hour was it?</p>
<p> <lb n="40893"/>There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne
<lb n="40894"/>to him over the air. But the tide was near the turn and already
<lb n="40895"/>the day was on the wane. He turned landward and ran towards
<lb n="40896"/>the shore and, running up the sloping beach, reckless of the
<lb n="40897"/>sharp shingle, found a sandy nook amid a ring of tufted sand-
<lb n="40898"/>knolls and lay down there that the peace and silence of the
<lb n="40899"/>evening might still the riot of his blood.</p>
<p> <lb n="40900"/>He  felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm
<lb n="40901"/>processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him,
<lb n="40902"/>the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.</p>
<p> <lb n="40903"/>He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids
<lb n="40904"/>trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth
<lb n="40905"/>and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of
<lb n="40906"/>some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world,
<lb n="40907"/>fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy
<lb n="40908"/>shapes and beings. A world, a glimmer, or a flower? Glimmering
<lb n="40909"/>ing and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking light,
<lb n="40910"/>an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself,
<lb n="40911"/>breaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest
<lb n="40912"/>rose, leaf by leaf and wave of light by wave of light, flooding all
<lb n="40913"/>the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than other.</p>
<p> <lb n="40914"/>Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid
<lb n="40915"/>grasses of his bed glowed no longer. He rose slowly and, re-
<lb n="40916"/>calling the rapture of his sleep, sighed at its joy.</p>
<p> <lb n="40917"/>He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him.
<lb n="40918"/>Evening had fallen. A rim of the young moon cleft the pale
<lb n="40919"/>waste of sky like the rim of a silver hoop embedded in grey
<lb n="40920"/>sand: and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with a low
<lb n="40921"/>whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant
<lb n="40922"/>pools.</p> </div><!-- 4.3 --> </div><!-- Chapter 4 -->
